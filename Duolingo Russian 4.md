Now you can tell where you live:

*   на юге Берли́на = *in the south of Berlin* (i.e. inside the city)
*   к югу от Берли́на = *to the south of Berlin* (i.e. in another settlement outside of the city)


### «Двор» and "courtyard"

The word «**двор**» requires some attention. Technically it can be either *yard* or *courtyard* in English because it means either a piece of land at the house or an area inside a group of buildings.

In this course it is "courtyard". After all, you'll mostly encounter «двор» when people refer to the area enclosed by a group of buildings as opposed to the area by the street. Don't expect it to look idyllic, though.

### Locative

Just a reminder that there are certain short masculine nouns for places which have a stressed **-у** ending in the Prepositional, instead of the *-е* which you'd expect. Ex.: на полу́, на мосту́, в шкафу́, в лесу́, на берегу́, в порту́, на льду́,  на углу́ в саду́,  в снегу́.

###### It is not a variant form, i.e. its use is obligatory, which makes it the strongest "extra" case in Russian.

### the Pseudo-passive

###### It is very common in Russian to use the 3rd person plural of a verb without any "they" to express that the action **is performed** by unspecified "persons":

###### This particular wording won't work if you describe something that happens "by itself".

### хвата́ть

Using the impersonal verb «хвата́ть» is one of the ways to express the idea of having enough of something. The person is used in Dative while the thing you have or do not have enough of is stated in Genitive:

*   Мне не хвата́ет де́нег. = I do not have enough money.
*   Нам хвата́ет еды́. = We have enough food.
*   Ей хвата́ет рабо́ты. = She has enough work.


The perfective counterpart is «хвати́ть».


## Reflexive

 ### In theory

The reflexive is used when a subject performs an action "on itself". In English it is generally not stated explicitly. When you say that someone *shaves* or *stops*, it is understood that the action relates to themselves, unless a different "object" is provided.

These verbs end in -**ся** /-**сь** in Russian («ся» after a consonant, «сь» after a vowel)

As a rule, these verbs never take a direct object in the Accusative. «Бояться» (to be afraid of) is one of the few exceptions, in that it can use Accusative for people.

### In practice

Russian reflexive verbs may mean a number of things. Here are the most popular meanings:

*   *true reflexive*: мыться, бриться. Mostly for verbs like "wash", "shave", "comb your hair".
*   *reciprocal ("each other")*: встречаться, целоваться, "meet/date/go out with", "kiss".
*   *passive* (for imperfective verbs only): Еда готовится лучшими поварами. "The food is (being) prepared by the best chefs"
*   *emotional state or some movement/change*: родиться, удивиться, учиться, радоваться, меняться, двигаться, "to be born", "to be surprised", "to learn", "to be glad", "to change", "to move".
*   *inclination to do something (in impersonal constructions)*: Мне не спится = I do not feel like sleeping.
*   *lexical verbs that are reflexive for no particular reason*: нравиться, бояться, заниматься, садиться. Some of these are only used with *«-ся»*. Some also exist in a "bare" form but mean a completely different thing.


###### We do not have some of the non-reflexive base verbs in the course (some are rare or just a little beyond what we could include in the course and not make it overly long). However, some just don't exist.

### себя

**«Себя»** is a reflexive object pronoun: it means the same thing as the subject of the verb (or the implied subject, if the sentence doesn't contain a subject):

*   Посмотри на себя! = Look at yourself!
*   Мы не думали о себе. = We didn't think about ourselves.
*   Он говорит сам с собой. = He is talking to himself («сам с собой» is just more idiomatic here)


Note that, as usual for pronouns, it is much more natural before the verb. Its declension pattern is, naturally, the same as for «меня» or «тебя». Since it can't be the subject of the sentence, it doesn't have a Nominative form.

It is also used with some verbs:

*   **чувствовать себя** = to feel (a certain way)
*   представить (себе) = to imagine
*   вести себя = to behave
*   брать с собой = to take along ("with yourself")
*   выходить из себя = to lose one's temper


(«с собой» then is generally used to express having something with you or "on one's person", not only with "брать")

Remember the «Мы *у друга*»-structures? They work here, too:

*   Я *у себя*. = I am at my place.
*   Мы *у себя* дома. = We are at (our) home.


### Other

*   reflexive verbs for some *actions (often harmful) typical of a subject*: Собака кусается = The dog bites.


It often works for animals and people (to scratch, to butt, to swear). However, in a sense, it is also the meaning in "Книга легко читается", which corresponds to "The book is easy to read", i.e. usually it "is read" without difficulty (by whoever reads it).

*   *про себя* = "to oneself" (as opposed to "aloud")
*   *сам по себе* = on its own
*   *само собой (разумеется)* = "it goes without saying"
*   Мне *не по себе*. = I feel uneasy/sick/uncomfortable.


## Time expressions 2

 ### More popular time expressions

*   **теп́ерь** is the word for "now" when you mean that there is a *change* from how it was *before* ("Now I live in Rome", "What do we do now!?", "Now you know Russian"). We are pretty lenient on the distinction in the course, though.
*   use **«через» + Accusative** to express an amount of time that should pass before the event comes («через неделю» = in a week, a week later).
*   use **Accusative + «назад»** to express "X time ago"(«сто лет назад» = 100 years ago). «Тому назад» means the same thing but this use has been quickly losing its popularity since WWII and isn't taught here (it is mostly characteristic of people born before 1950).
*   **по + Dative pl.** expresses "on Mondays" etc.


### рисо**ва**ть, планиро**ва**ть...

Verbs with suffixes **-ова/-ева** replace it with **уй** sound in their present tense stem. The actual endings will be **-ую, -уешь, -ует** and so on:

*   Я рисую, планирую, анализирую, радуюсь
*   Она рисует, анализирует ... 


There is also an unproductive class of verbs with -**давать**, -**ставать**, -**знавать** that exhibits similar behaviour (**ва**→**й**): 

*   Я даю, встаю, 
*   Ты даёшь, узнаёшь. 


It's small, but it has some popular imperfective verbs like «вставать» (get up), «давать» (give), «уставать» (get tired) and «узнавать» (to learn *some piece of information*).


## Imperative and Adverbs

 ### Two types of imperative

Not hard at all.

First, look at the 3rd person plural: *читают, пишут, любят* and so on. Remove the ending. 

*   if you are left with a vowel at the end, add **Й**
*   if you are left with a consonant, add **И** after a consonant cluster or "л" (otherwise, just **ь**). 


Done! *Читай, пиши, люби*. To make it plural or polite, just add **-те**: *читайте*.

This lesson deals with the И-pattern plus some irregular forms. However, the pattern described above works for the vast majority of the verbs. The irregular stems give you *ешь, дай, беги*.

### Aspect is imperative

Which aspect to use? Well, if you focus on the process ("Please, slice *evenly*") or encourage engaging in some activity,  use imperfective. Otherwise, especially If you want to get a result or a single specific action, use perfective. 

When forbidding something, use the imperfective.

You may notice that sometimes when Russians want a specific action (let's call that "simple request"), they *still* use imperfective. Why? Here is the prototypal meaning of such usage:

*   the initial phase of the action is accented (overriden for some verbs) 
*   it is a *contextually obvious* action ("Please, do come in!", "Now, turn in your tests") → or else it sounds quite assertive — may be a desired result 
*   a simple action is expected to be performed immediately


By the way, that "obvious" point is why imperfectives are not, as a rule, used for *detailed* "simple requests", especially with "please". It is OK for some typical guest-receiving situations ("please, come in", "please sit down"). But IMP. is out of question with clearly non-obvious detailed requests like "Take my cat from the sofa, please" — how can such thing be obvious, and if so, why would you ask in such detail? These two contradict each other: appealing to the listener's common sense ('You should obviously do that') while at the same time using 'please' and giving the details.


## Verbs of Motion

 ### Run: there and back again

Russian verbs of motion come in two varieties:

*   a **one-way**, specific verb (like *идти́*→). They're used for one-way trips strictly to/from some goal (usually a single instance)
*   a **multi-directional** verb (like *ходи́ть*⇆)


### Multi-directional verbs ⇆↝

They can express three different things:

*   **repeated** trips: «Я *хожу́* в школу» 
*   **a round trip**: «Где ты была?»—«*Ходи́ла* в магази́н».
*   **moving with no goal** or referring the action/trip in general: «Моя́ до́чка уже́ *хо́дит*».


From a practical point of view, a *one-way verb* is virtually always a Continuous tense in English, while a *multidirectional* verb corresponds with a Simple tense or the Present Perfect (a trip happened→"I've been there - and come back"). Or to a Continuous tense when it is a random movement.

*   *Pay attention to* ***бежа́ть*** *(to run→), which is an irregular verb (though, only a little bit).*


### Pairs (→ / ⇆)

*   идти́ / ходи́ть – movement on foot or within a city; also OK when talking about a public transportation route
*   е́хать / е́здить – movement by vehicle on land, also a generic verb for travelling to other countries.
*   лете́ть / лета́ть – "to fly", to move though air
*   плы́ть / пла́вать – "to swim", to move by water
*   нести́ / носи́ть – "to carry" an object, on foot
*   везти́ / вози́ть – "to carry" a person/object, by some means of transportation 
*   вести́ / води́ть – to "lead" a person, on foot (also about roads and about "driving" a vehicle)


Up to 14 or 18 verbs of motion are found in Russian, though we only teach 3 to 5 common ones.

### Waaait, what about perfectives?

To make a perfective (*specific!*) verb, add a prefix «по-» to a one-way verb (идти́→пойти́). It gives a perfective with an implied focus on the initial point ("setting out"). 

*   

other prefixes add their meaning; to get an imperfective verb, attach the same prefix to a multi-directional verb (уйти/уходи́ть, уе́хать/уезжа́ть, прилете́ть/прилета́ть etc.) Pay attention to «-*езжать*». 

*   

*With "по-" the imperfective meaning differs (a rather typical shade "to perform an action for some time")*



## City and People

 ### Stop right there!

What you call a place where some transport stops, that depends on the transport. The trains stop at «ста́нция» while bus and tram stops are «остано́вка» (*«авто́бусная», «тролле́йбусная», «трамва́йная»*). 

Note the **Locative 2** in *мост* and *угол*(corner): на мосту́, на углу́, в углу́.

«Маршру́тка» is a minibus that travels at semi-regular intervals, often trying to take an adequate amount of passengers at the starting point. Most will follow the same route as the regular bus of the same number. Due to translation difficulties, it is not covered in this course.

**«Вокза́л»** is a large railway station with a station building, often a terminus but not necessarily (that's where you would look for an inter-city train). 

### Englishman and Englishwoman

Most popular names for people from different countries or ethnic groups will have a version for males and another for females. Look for a suffix, since the formation of these kind of nouns is extremely typical: англича́нин/англича́нка, испа́нец/испа́нка, шве́д/шведка, коре́ец/корея́нка, кита́ец/китая́нка, францу́з/францу́женка, гре́к/греча́нка...

### Other point of interest

Railway is «**желе́зная доро́га**» in Russian (lit. 'iron road'). «**Суперма́ркет**», while sometimes similar to *supermarkets* you know, is usually a medium-size self-service shop selling primarily groceries and some other essentials, so *grocery store* is closer to the definition.


## Imperative 2

 ### Perfective vs. Imperfective

Certainly use *imperfective* when specifying the manner in which the action should be performed.

Use *perfective* when asking for a simple action without it being really obvious next action. 

###### *Certainly, with "Please" and following details, since it is really rare you would politely ask for an obvious thing to do.*

There is also the important permission/denial pattern:
use **imperfective** when **NOT letting** something.

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Feel yourself at home

Curiously enough, **imperfectives** are absolutely polite for a few common motion and action verbs used when inviting people:

*   Садитесь, пожалуйста = Please, sit down,
*   Приходите ещё! = Do come again.
*   Входите, пожалуйста. = Come in, please. (also «проходите», lit. "come through", and «заходите»)


I guess they can be formally classified as *obvious* but you can also just memorize the verbs.

### положить ↔ поставить

There is a distinction in Russian between putting things in a random or "lying flat" position and "setting" them into a vertical or *upright* position. The last one is important for things that by design are supposed to have a "working" orientation even if they are flat (a plate, a cup, a box, a bed, a laptop etc.)

*   use *ставить/поставить* for a stable or vertical position (as a result, the object *стоит*)
*   use *класть/положить* for a flat, upset or random orientation (as a result, the object *лежит*)


### Words

*   **садитесь** is commonly used as an invitation to sit down. *Присаживайтесь* is also very popular despite being usually recommended against (literally, it means to perform a squat or to sit down for a short while).


## Something

 ### который

«Который» ("that/which") is like an adjective, only it takes the gender of whichever object it "represents", and the case that corresponds to its role in the part of the sentence you use it in:

*   Где *книга*, **которую** я *ищу*?
*   Где *книга*, **о которой** мы *говорили*?


### Real or not: *-то* vs. *-нибудь*

**кто-нибудь** and **что-нибудь** mean a "hypothetical" object. A slot you have in mind, not actually filled by anything in particular (and maybe you are wrong). Mostly useless in statements about the past (if you are sure it happened, then the object did exist)

###### (remember, «кто» is masculine, «что» is neuter)

**кто-то** and **что-то** refer to a specific but "unknown" object. You see/know that *something* exists (or you are sure of it) but you don't know its identity.

They are somewhat interchangeable when you mean there's free choice from a limited number of options ("OK, have *someone* call me if Alex comes").

***NB***: "any-" pronouns have wider use in English. When "anyone" means "whichever person you want", consider "кто угодно" or, if you mean everyone, "все". The above only applies to cases of an "unknown" object.

### I've got something special for you!

**Кое-что* and *Кое-кто* are "secret" pronouns. They mean a certain object that you know but are deliberately not mentioning by name. Either you want to keep people guessing or do not consider the identity important to your point ("Yeah, I have worked with *some people* here").

### Special cases

*Когда-нибудь* is used mainly for "ever" in the past or "one day" in the future. *Когда-то* is mostly for "once" in the past; almost never used in future.

*Как-нибудь* is also sometime used to refer to some future moment rather than manner of action.

*Где-то* is also used colloquially to mean "approximately*.

*Кое-как* is only an adverb, which either means a job done sloppily or an action performed "barely", with difficulty.


## Technics and Home

 ### пойду́

Here we introduce the prefixed *perfective* for "to go(walk)" — **пойти́**.  It is a perfective verb with a focus on "setting out" somewhere, just like other verbs of motion with «по-» («пое́хать», «побежа́ть», «полете́ть», «пове́сти»).

### Поезд идёт до станции «Блок»

It is completely normal to use «идти» when talking about public transportation, i.e. passenger vehicles that repeatedly follow a prescribed route. These are preferred when talking about routes. Typically, it is **идти** because we treat it more like an objective fact of a certain trip taking you somewhere than a particular vehicle going to a certain place (almost as if «идти» is not used as a verb of motion but as a way of stating the destination). «Ходить» is also used: for example, when saying that a bus exists that takes you from one place to another.

When arriving at a terminal station on a subway, you can hear the following:

*   Поезд дальше не идёт. Просьба выйти из вагона. ~ lit. *The train goes no further. Please exit from the car.*


A personal vehicle will always use *ехать/ездить*.

***A reminder***: you use *ONE-WAY verbs* when describing motion in one direction, even if repeated. The verbs cease being interchangeable when the context of repeated motion implies the "trip back" cannot be included (like "After school I go to the station and take a train home."— here you have a sequence that makes the return trip absurd). We rarely have such sentences in the course. In real life, just remember to occasionally take a step back and refresh the basic idea behind the opposition: one-way motion vs. multi-directional trip.


## Future & Past with Perfectives

 ### Formation

Take a perfective verb and do the same thing you do to imperfectives in the Present. Seriously. The reason is that perfective verbs have no Present form in Russian.

<td align="center">Я сде́лаю три стола́. = I'll make three desks.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Whenever you mean a **"simple"**, single action and/or a specific result, this is THE form you'll want to use. There is also another way of talking about the future, *"буду"+imperfective infinitive* but we're leaving that for later.

### Conditionals

We're introducing the basics of **«если»**("if") in this skill. In Russian you use it with the Future when talking about future events (which is different from English).
Compare: If you *see* (present tense with future meaning) Jenny, call me = Если ты *увидишь* (future perfective of 'to see') Дженни, скажи мне, lit. 'If you *will see* Jenny, call me.'

**Пусть** (let/have) is used with the non-past forms.

###### Basically, most learners tend to use too many perfective verbs in the Past and too many imperfectives in the Future. Also, another common mistake is "future projection" of present tense forms. E.g. "I'm doing that tomorrow morning". In Russian, it does not generally work that way, though sometimes it is OK.

### Mutation

That stuff with «Она готовит»/«Я готов**л**ю». In *И-conjugation* it only happens in 1st person singular, and in *Е-conjugation* it happens everywhere.


## Being Instrumental

 ### Working and being

Instrumental, while being a relatively niche case, is used for a number of verbs that mean "being" something (or someone) and "being interested" in something. For example, with **быть** when in the Past or the Future. 

**«Явля́ться»** is a formal verb for "to be" which you must know but you won't necessarily use all that much. One important use would be somewhat formal sentences of the model '*'A' is a 'B' that is a 'C'*.' Imagine something like this:

*   These days, a school principal is a person who is usually not a teacher ~ В наше время директор школы — человек, который обычно не является учителем. 


A somewhat stilted example, but still quite good because it would sound strange here to omit "являться" (to be) in the 2nd half of this sentence. Fortunately, these sorts of definitions are often "A is a B who does C", so you don't have to worry too much.

**«Занима́ться»** is a verb that has no direct equivalent in English and therefore can be tricky to translate. It has a general meaning of "being occupied with something", which means pursuing some activity (cf. *заня́тие* "occupation, class", *за́нят* "busy"). 

Depending on the nature of the activity it can be any of the following:

*   learning *занима́юсь испа́нским*
*   hobby: *занима́юсь ролевы́ми и́грами* 
*   work: *занима́юсь исто́рией славя́н*
*   sports: *занима́юсь футбо́лом*
*   current activity or occupation: *Чем ты занима́ешься* ~What are you doing/What do you do?


There is also **«увлека́ться»** which is more directly connected to hobbies (*увлече́ния*) which you are *"keen on" or "into"* e.g. *я увлекаюсь иностранными языками*.

###### *Два́, три́, четы́ре* become *двумя́, тремя́, четырьмя́*

Note how after hushes (*ж, ш, щ, ч*), **ой** is used for end-stressed adjectives and **ей** for stem-stressed ones. That reflects the pronunciation: after a hush, unstressed *о/а*  sound the same as an unstressed и/е would.


## Placing Objects

 ### Object placement in Russian

This concept is hard to translate but easy to grasp. Frankly, Russians (on average) tend to be more precise about the manner in which an object "is" somewhere or is "put" somewhere. 

"Being" verbs do not have natural perfective counterparts because they are about a certain state.

### Stand

**Стоя́ть** is used with "vertical" positions:

*   **a vertical orientation** of a long or thin object (a book, a ski leaning against a wall etc.)
*   **a stable position** of an object that has a "base" by design: plates, cups, shoes, boxes, furniture etc.
*   about buildings, especially large. But not about rooms (offices, for examples).


### Lie

**Лежа́ть** is used with "horizontal" orientations:

*   **a flat position** of an object like book, a closed laptop, clothes, sheet of paper
*   **a sideways position** of an object that is "normally" placed in a stable position ("stands")


### Hanging about

**Висе́ть** is used with hanging/clinging objects:

*   pictures, mirrors, notices, fridge magnets
*   clothes on a hanger, curtains, ropes
*   clothes hanging over a chair etc.


That's all. When you *place* an object into one of these three positions you use «ста́вить»(поста́вить), «класть»(положи́ть) and «ве́шать»(пове́сить) respectively. This also applies if you change an object's state (eg., it is lying flat, and you want it hung on a wall).

Use a "present-style" set of endings of a perfective verb to make its future form: «Я повешу картину тут/сюда» = *I'll hang the picture here*.

###### Mind the *класть / положи́ть* pair, where the imperfective and perfective forms come from different roots.

### Be situated

Better late than never, I guess. There are a few verbs that only ever denote position, of which only «находи́ться» is within the scope of this course. The verb is often used with large objects like buildings, rooms, cities. However, it is not limited to these kinds of objects (it's just less not quite as common).

«Находи́ться» can sound overly formal in some situations. Basically, it is a verb that specifies the whereabouts of the subject, so it is appropriate when  location truly IS in focus. Do not use it with people much, except in questions regarding the exact whereabouts (e.g., over the phone when you are trying to find your friends: «Где вы сейча́с находи́тесь?») With small objects "lie"/"stand", discussed above, are probably a better choice.


## Kitchen and Food

 ### есть

The verb «есть» (to eat) doesn't have a true perfective partner according to some sources. Its perfective counterpart would depend on the meaning:

*   I ate an apple → съесть
*   I had a bite to eat then went to the museum → пое́сть


So, when you mean consuming a certain "object", you use «съесть» to express that the object is fully eaten (within reason, it obviously doesn't have to be the seeds, core and all to 'count'!) However, when you are talking about the activity of eating as replenishing your energy, having a lunch break etc., use «пое́сть». In this skill we teach «съесть».

###### "Я пое́л суп/су́па" would mean that you ate some soup, focusing on the fact of having a meal rather than full consumption. This will sound strange with small foodstuffs which are typically eaten completely (sandwiches, apples etc.) If this is the case, it's better to outright state that you ate a piece or took a bite of something.

### килограмм

When counting, the Genitive plural form for «грамм» and «килограмм» may be either of the following:

*   5 гра́ммов / 5 килогра́ммов
*   5 грамм / 5 килогра́мм


The zero-ending option is definitely the most popular these days, at least in speech (it was considered colloquial about 40 years ago).

### пакет

«Су́мка» is a bag made of a durable material. An expendable plastic or paper bag typical of supermarkets is «паке́т». And it is actually *полиэтиле́новый* (polyethylene), not *пла́стиковый* (which is usually used for hard plastics).

«Пакет» is also used for *packs* of sugar, salt, rice, milk etc.


## Speaking2

 ### счита́ть vs. ду́мать

When expressing your opinion, you may use either of the two. «Счита́ть» implies that you think so because of your views, or because that would be your decision, or because you gave it some thought. «Ду́мать» can mean a lot of things, a random, incidental thought included. 

Basically, you just have to know that «счита́ть» may mean something other than "to count", and as for using it yourself... well, depends on your exposure to Russian.

### име́ть

«име́ть» is a formal verb for "to have" used in business and official language (*у кого-то есть что-то* is neutral). However, there are a few set expressions where the verb can be used even in normal speech.

*   **«име́ть в виду́»** = "to mean". When a person *means* something, it is what they wanted to say.
*   **«име́ть пра́во»/«не име́ть пра́ва»** = "to have the/a right to"/ "to have no right to".
*   **«име́ть большо́е значе́ние»** = "to be of great importance" (you may replace "great" with your epithet of choice)
*   *«име́ть смысл»* = "to be not unreasonable/to have some sense"
*   *«име́ть что-то про́тив»* = "to mind" (to be against something). Usually in the negative.


## Subjunctive and Conditional

 ### Want me to do it?

The Subjunctive is, basically, when you speak of actions that are not *real* but rather *desired*, *asked to be performed* or just actions that *might have happened*.

One of the important uses of conditional (a.k.a. subjunctive) in Russian is with «чтобы» ("in order to") to express the idea of some action being required or asked for from someone.

**1 entity**→*infinitive*. The sentence is pretty straightforward when you only have one person:

*   Я рано встаю, **чтобы** не *опаздывать*. = I get up early so that I won't be late.


**2 entities**→*past*. When A does something for B to do something, use *PAST tense* in subjunctive:

*   Он хочет, **чтобы** я *жил* = He wants me to live.
*   Мама просит, **чтобы** завтра ты *был* дома = Mom asks that you would be home tomorrow.
*   Я рано встаю, **чтобы** ты не *забыл* позавтракать. = I get up early so that you would not forget to have breakfast. 


In more formal English it would look like *"Mother asks that you be home tomorrow"*, though English has more idiomatic ways of saying that.

So, use the past to form the subjunctive in any structures like "A told B to do something", "A did X so that B would do Y", "We need that A do X" etc. The analogy with the English "that" (which might come off as overly formal) is probably a good way to grasp all these structures, since, unfortunately, in more idiomatic English the sentence structures would be quite different to the Russian.

◉ *Pay attention to the use of aspect. When asking someone NOT to do something, **imperfective** is normally used.*

*   With verbs of asking, you only use the past form if you do use a subjunctive phrase. If you've opted to use a Dative "recipient" instead, the verb is in the infinitive:* Мы попросили его подождать.


### If only you were here...

The conditional, unsurprisingly, is also used in conditional sentences. When you describe hypothetical (unreal) situations, you always use **Past** +  the particle **бы**. This particle normally comes right after *если* or after the subject / the verb:

*   *Если бы* ты знал физику, то получил *бы* пять. = If you knew Physics, you'd have got an 'A'.
*   Я хотела *бы* знать больше языков. = I'd like to know more languages.


Russian does not distinguish (grammatically) between "would be" and "would have been"; they both just use past and are distinguished based on what makes sense in a given situation.


## Compound Future

 ### Imperfective future

There is another way of expressing the future in Russian besides the perfective covered earlier, namely (you guessed it) the imperfective. Its primary use is to show some prolonged or repeated activity in the future rather than to focus on a single action done at some particular point in time. (It tends to be overused by foreign learners). 

To form the imperfective future, use the appropriate variation of **будет** and an infinitive of an imperfective verb:

*   Завтра я буду спать = I'll be sleeping tomorrow
*   Они будут весь день учиться = They are going to be studying all day.
*   Летом я буду больше бегать = I'm going to run more in the summer.
*   Будете есть торт? = Will you eat the cake?


It is quite useful for describing what you will generally be occupied with at a certain moment or day ("at 3 p.m. I'll still be working") in the future.

### I will not do this!

There is one more important verb to discuss here. «Стать» (to become) is used with an infinitive in negative sentences to express a decision not to do something, both in past and in future.:

*   Я не стану смотреть этот фильм! = I will not watch this movie!
*   Вчера она не стала готовить обед. = Yesterday she did not cook lunch (because she chose not to).


We mostly skip the past use because English does not actually distinguish between the past action that just did not happen and the past actions that were not taken because a person decided not to. *Стать* is also used (to a degree) in positive past sentences to mean "started doing the prolonged activity". Quite a rare thing in future.


## Prefixed Verbs of Motion

 ### Back in Motion

Having covered the basic verbs of motion earlier, it's time to go a bit deeper.

While English often uses additional words and/or a completely different verb to convey different nuances of movement somewhere, Russian typically takes one of the basic verbs of motion and modifies it with a prefix.

They often come in pairs, so we have:

**при**- expresses approaching in a general way. Иван **при**ехал в Россию = Ivan arrived in/came to Russia.
**у**- conveys going away or leaving. Дженни **у**ехала из Москвы = Jenny left Moscow.

**в**-/**во**- for movement into an enclosed space. Он **во**шёл в комнату. = He entered the room.
**вы**- for movement out of an enclosed space. Я **вы**йду из дома = I will leave the house.

**под**-/**подо**- movement towards. Он **подо**шёл ко мне = He walked up to me.
**от**-/**ото**- movement away from. Она **ото**шла от него = She walked away from him.

Also:

**про**- through or past. Мы **про**ехали туннель = we drove through the tunnel. Они **про**шли мимо церкви = They walked past a church.

**пере**- across Я **пере**шла/**пере**шёл мост = I crossed the bridge.

### A tricky aspect

You may have spotted so far that the examples have all been the one-directional versions of 'go' and that they are all past or future. Well, here's where it may get confusing. When they have a prefix attached, the one- and two- directional versions of 'go' convey aspect rather than 'directionality'. This probably makes more sense with an example:

Я пере**хожу** мост - I **am crossing** the bridge/I **cross** the bridge

Я пере**йду** мост - I **will cross** the bridge.
