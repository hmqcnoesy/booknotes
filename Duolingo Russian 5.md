### Tell us about it

There is another verb in Russian for "to tell", «рассказывать». It covers the situations when what you tell is quite a bit longer than a single sentence. You may link it to *рассказ* ("a story"). No brick walls here, only with «рассказать» it is understood you're passing on a rather finished piece of information about some topic. «Говорить/ сказать» is primarily for shorter answers where coverage of some topic is not the point (also, when reporting someone's words).

When expressing what you are talking "about", you may use **о** + Prepositional or **про** + Accusative. The meaning is roughly the same, especially in the sentences covered in this course, and they are largely interchangeable. In most situations only the shade of meaning changes:

*   «о» focuses more on the overall coverage
*   «про» focuses more on something "specific" and detailed but maybe not as true "in general"


«О» is a lot more frequent than «про».


## Together

### Let's speak Russian

To express the idea of "let's" (a suggestion or proposal to carry out an action or participate in some activity together) Russian uses the imperative *Давай* (plural *давайте*).

Use it with the **infinitive for imperfective** verbs:

*   Дава́йте чита́ть вме́сте.
*   Дава́й спать.
*   Дава́й рисова́ть.
*   Дава́йте говори́ть по-ру́сски.


Use it with non-past **"we"-form for perfective** verbs:

*   Дава́й прочита́ем расска́з.
*   Дава́йте пойдём в парк.
*   Дава́й напи́шем ей отве́т.
*   Дава́й нарису́ем дом


### Each other

The set expression «друг друга» is used to express the action done to "each other". The first "friend" is always in Nominative, and the second takes the case required by the sentence—and any prepositions you need:

*   Мы лю́бим друг дру́га. = We love each other
*   Они́ ду́мают друг о дру́ге. = They think about each other.


### Just the two of us

To express doing an action together, Russian may opt to use words that specify the number of people as 2, 3 etc: *вдвоём*, *втроём*, *вчетверо́м*, *впятеро́м*, *вшестеро́м*, *всемеро́м*, also *вдесятеро́м*. Two to four are used the most. 8, 9 or larger than 10 are virtually never used.

English just uses "together", so, understandably, these are useful to know but boring to translate:

*   Они́ жи́ли там вдвоём. = They lived there together *(the two of them)*


Bonus to those who speak languages that have similar adverbs.


## Numbers 2

### Ordinal numbers

Ordinal numbers decline exactly like adjectives. Fortunately, only the last word is declined, others are like in cardinal numbers. And no *and's*:

*   1904th = ты́сяча девятьсо́т четвёртый
*   2015th = две ты́сячи пятна́дцатый
*   in 2015th = в две ты́сячи пятна́дцатом


###### Actually, **«третий»** declines a bit differently, similar to "animal-possessives" (eg. кошачий): третий, третья, третье, третьи / третьего, третьей . . . Note the **Ь**.

### Declension of numbers

In Russian, tens and hundreds are compound words with both parts declining («сто» has an unusual pattern):

*   **пять·деся́т** (50) → о **пяти́·десяти** кни́гах
*   **шесть·деся́т** (60) → за **шестью́·десятью** дверьми
*   **две́·сти** (200) → **Двум·ста́м** ма́льчикам пришли́ пи́сьма


###### (you might recall that numbers 5-20 and also 30, 50,60,70,80 decline just like a feminine noun, eg. «кровать»)

Oblique cases of numbers are madness even for native speakers, so they usually either make mistakes, or think their way around such complicated forms. After all, no one makes you use convoluted sentence structure IRL.

Consequently, we are not spending much time on these forms.

### Use of adjectives with numbers

In Nominative expressions like "2/3/4 big cats" the agreement of the adjective may not match the noun.

For masculine and neuter nouns, you use the adjective in Genitive plural. For feminine nouns, there is variation. Typically, Nominative plural is preferred:

*   На столе две большие ложки.
*   Две молодые женщины ждут ответа.


However, if Gen.sg is different from Nom.plural (руки́-ру́ки) or if the verb is in singular — Genitive plural is better:

*   У меня есть старший брат и три **младших** *сестры*.
*   На столе *было* три **больших** тарелки.


If the adjective modfies the whole number phrase, only the Nominative is used: каждые три дня, долгие две недели, мои любимые четыре года.


## Adjectives 3

 Russian has a number of adjectives formed from other types of words, for examples, nouns. Where English might use a noun chain or a few nouns stitched together ("summer shirt", "homework"), we often use an adjective—of course, if the language has one («летняя рубашка», «домашняя работа»).

### знакомый

«Знакомый» is a word for "familiar", also widely used as a noun for "pal, acquiaintance" (*знакомый* for males, *знакомая* for females)


## Plans

### собира́ться

The focus of this skill is just one Russian verb, **«собира́ться»**. It means something between "to be going to" and "to plan/to intend to". The verb means that it is your intention to perform some action, and you are, most likely, taking some steps (physical or cognitive) to let it eventually happen:

*   Мы за́втра собира́емся пойти́ в кино́. = We are planning to to the movies tomorrow.
*   Они́ собира́ются ждать до пяти́. = They are planning(going) to wait till five.
*   Мы собира́лись погуля́ть по па́рку. = We were going to take a walk through the park.


It also has its plain literal meaning of "to gather" or "to pack your stuff, preparing to leave". Interestingly, when talking about going to some place where some "event" is taking place, its literal and mataphorical meaning work together, so the verb can be used directly with a place: «Я собира́юсь на ле́кцию».

The primary use of «собира́ться» is to show preplanned future actions of persons. Things and beings that do not have consciousness can only use this verb in its literal meaning.


## Prepositions 2

* **из-за** (+ Gen.) is a Genitive preposition with the meaning of "because". It is mostly used to name the cause of something **unpleasant** or time-consuming (eg. "They got fired because of you").

* **мимо** (+ Gen.) is a preposition meaning passing **by** something or missing the intended destination (target). It is quite productive in combination with verbs of motion having the **про-** prefix, which also works for the for the idea of "passing", "continuing motion despite reaching some point".

* **вместо** (+ Gen.) means "instead", "in place of"—for examples, when expressing something being "replaced" by something else (hence the «место» part).



## The Same

### одинаковый / такой же

Consider these two structures:

*   Ann and Bob are the same (as each other).
*   Ann and Bob are the same (as you).


English uses "the same" for both. Russian expresses these two relations differently:

*   Том и Тим одина́ковые.
*   Том и Тим таки́е же (, как ты).


### Other similar things

A number of these «же»-words exist:

*   тот же X = the same X →usually the same object
*   тако́й же X = the same (kind of) X → usually the object with the same characteristics
*   так же = in the same way
*   тогда́ же = at the same time
*   там же = at the same place
*   туда́ же = to the same place


###### *NB: «же» has other uses, namely to emphasize the information the listener must be aware of but fails to use (Ты же сам меня́ спроси́л).*

When comparing to something else, a paired pronoun is used in a relative clause:

*   Это тот же челове́к, что и вчера́. = This is the same person as yesterday.
*   Она́ живёт там же, где и мы. = *She lives at the same place where we do.*
*   Мы рабо́таем тогда́ же, когда́ и вы. = *We work at the same time as you.*


Note the "и", which makes it a lot more natural.

The usage of these pronouns is not as obvious. *Тако́й же* is typically paired with *как*  and *тот же* with *что* or *кото́рый*(for persons). 

### I don't care

To say that you "don't care", "don't give a (smth)" about something, you use «всё равно́» with Dative subject.

*   Мне всё равно́, что ты поду́маешь.


You also use it to say that doing something is "essentially the same thing" as something else.

### Set expressions

«Тут же» actually means *"right away"*.

You can say something is **"one and the same"** object by using «оди́н и тот же» or «оди́н» (the latter is OK when it's a modifier):

*   Мы живём в одно́м (и том же) до́ме.
*   Тома́т и помидо́р — э́то одно́ и то же.


(*одно́ и то же* as a "noun" is always neuter and cannot be replaced by *одно́*)

You can say something is **the same object as** already mentioned before by using «тот же са́мый»:

*   Это та же са́мая статья́! = *That's the same very article!*
*   Вы уве́рены, что это тот же са́мый челове́к? =  *Are you sure that's exactly the same man (as before)?*


## Fleeting Vowels

 Sometimes a word gets an extra vowel or loses a vowel when declined to a different form:

*   1 чашка → 5 чашек
*   1 день → 2 дня
*   1 кусок → 2 куска


It only happens to О and Е and will mostly give you trouble in words having certain suffixes. Such sounds are called *fleeting vowels* and appear/disappear quite regularly in some stems. 

►if a vowel appears, it only happens in Genitive plural

► if a vowel vanishes, it is everywhere except Nominative singular.

Here, we maily focus on the following words:

*   those that have -**ок/ек** (ец) as a suffix. The vowel disappears in all forms except Nom.sg)
*   feminine nouns with the suffix **-к**. Usually a vowel appears in Genitive plural. Е appears after "soft" consonants or hushes (дочек, чашек), О appears everywhere else (банок).
*   some nouns that have vowels appear or disappear in the stem consonant cluster


The existence of these vowels can be traced back to the time when Ь and Ъ used to be short vowels ("yers"). Back then, all syllables in Russian had to end in a vowel. Later, these sounds were lost in weak positions (word-final position or the position before a stressed vowel/a strong position). 

But that's history. Anyway, it is nice to know that in  «сто»/«сотня» (a hundred), «со мной» there is a good reason for "о" to be where it is. The disappearing vowel in «весь»/«все» has the same origin.

### Some of the fleeting vowels in Modern Russian have appeared from an analogy with other words and have no historical basis in Old East Slavic.


## Measure

 Russia uses the metric system. Here are the main units you'll learn in this course:

*   метр (meter): a bit longer than a yard
*   киломе́тр (kilometer): 1000 meters, or about 0.6 miles
*   килогра́мм (kilogram): a bit over 2 pounds
*   то́нна (tonne): 1000 kilograms, roughly equivalent to ton (or about 2205 pounds, to be more exact)


Square («квадратный») meters and kilometers are used for areas (м², км²).

###### For areas of land, «гекта́р» (Га, 10000 м²)  is often used. In spoken speech people also use «со́тка» (100 м²) for their garden plots in the country (the name comes from the fact that it is 1/100 of a hectare)

### Instrumental

To speak about an object of a certain length/weight etc., the Instrumental form of a quality is used:

*   стол длино́й 2 ме́тра = a table 2 meters long
*   о́зеро глубино́й 30 ме́тров = a lake 30 meters deep
*   дом высото́й 20 этаже́й = a house 20 storeys tall


### про-*verbs*

To express the idea of a certain activity "covering" a certain space or time interval, verbs with the prefix «про-» are often employed. Of course, you should consult the dictionary to know if a certain verb of this structure exists or has that particular meaning.

It is different from verbs of motion like "пройти" because many other verb can have this prefixs:

*   Мы прошли́ 5 киломе́тров = We walked 5 kilometers
*   Я проспа́л весь день. = I slept the entire day.
*   Мы простоя́ли тут два часа́. = We stood here for two hours.


NOTE about VERBS OF MOTION: some of these derivatives will not be verbs of motion and actually can differ in stress or form (проезжа́л/прое́здил). We are only covering distances here. You see, when talking about motion, the derivative of the one-way verb is used for distance. For times, you use just the multidirectional verb, or, if you want to put an emphasis on how extremely long it took, its про-prefixed derivative:

*   Я пробежа́л 6 миль.
*   Я (про)бе́гал пять часо́в.


The проходи́л, пробе́гал, прое́здил options are not neutral in style but are encountered in spoken speech anyway.


## Business

### организовать

One of the verbs introduced here deserves special attention. «Организовать» belongs to a small group of so-called *biaspectual* verbs. These verbs work both as a perfective and an imperfective verb—the interpretation depends on context and common sense:

*   Он атакует. = He is attacking.
*   Он атакует утром. = He will attack in the morning.
*   Мы организуем концерты. = We organize concerts.
*   Они обязательно организуют встречу. = They will, surely, organize a meeting.


### работать над чем-то

"Working on something" is a set expression in Russian too. Use «над» with the Instrumental:

*   Инженеры и учёные **работают над решением** этой проблемы = Engineers and scientist are already *working on a solution* to that problem.


### успешный

The adjective "successful" is mostly used with nouns meaning some endeavors or attempts to do something; also with nouns like "company", "businessman".

Their use with random words for people is also creeping in slowly (as a calque from English) but it is going to sound weird and awkward for quite a while. Unlike English, this usage in Russian is mainly associated with fame and financial success, so it limits the professions that feel "right" and unambiguous when described as «успешный».


## Prefixes

 *Though English has words like **undergo**, **ongoing** or **rearrange**, making new words from old ones is not a particularly productive way of building the core vocabulary in English. Russian has quite a number of prefixes and suffixes routinely used in words, including those in your essential vocabulary.*

*Such verbs have natural polysemy (in layman's terms: a handful of somewhat related meanings). For example, **собрать** means both "to gather, to pick up" (eg. flowers) and "to assemble" (eg. an IKEA chair).*

### prefixes

*   **пере-** has a rough meaning of *re-* or *over*-doing, passing some limit or extensively doing the action.
*   **раз-/рас-** often expresses action "outward", scattering or splitting apart (physically or metaphorically). It also has a meaning of inducing an "excited" state.


## History & Fantasy

### Да здра́вствует коро́ль!

The Russian "Long live the X" structure is an example of the high-style 3rd-person imperative. It sounds solemn and is typical of old texts. One more example:

*   Да бу́дет свет! = Let there be light!


### за́мок / замо́к

"A castle" and "a lock" are spelt the same in Russian; only the stress is different. Such use is a calque from German. Or rather WAS—in Polish. The Russian word for "castle" is borrowed from Polish, hence its penultimate stress:

*   Мы наконе́ц взя́ли за́мок. = We finally took the castle.


### Борьба́ добра́ со злом.

*Good* and *evil* as concepts are «добро́» and «зло». If you want to describe a person or a deed as good or evil, use adjectives «до́брый» and «злой». 

The former used to mean "good" as in "not bad"; this is why you have «доброе утро». In modern Russian this meaning is largely gone.

### Храм

A larger (in layman's terms) Christian church building is called a «храм», which is also a word for places of worship belonging to other religions/belief systems.

### World War II

The Russian expressions for the two world wars of the 20th century are «Пе́рвая мирова́я война́» and «Втора́я мирова́я война́». In less official texts and speech they work just fine without «война»:

*   Этот фильм был снят ещё до второй мировой. = This movie was filmed before World War II.


## An Introduction to Participles

 A participle is a form of a verb used as an adjective:

*   I see a girl drawing a horse. = Я ви́жу де́вочку, рису́ющую ло́шадь. 


Participles behave like adjectives, so they have the same set of endings and grammatical cases. The difference is, you don't use a full participle as a predicate. Also, a participle phrase can precede the noun, though a usual position of such phrase is afterwards:

*   Я ви́жу рису́ющую ло́шадь де́вочку.


They are generally considered characteristic of a bookish or formal style, which is why we are only covering them briefly to get you familiar enough with the concept that you'll recognise them when you bump into one when reading a text. This is really just a glimpse of what's there—the course would be incomplete without the participles but you don't have to use them (and, in fact, you're better off not using them, at least when speaking).

Some participles have crystallized into adjectives, too:

*   говоря́щий попуга́й = a talking parrot.


### How To

Russian verbs have present and past participles, which can be either active or passive (only transitive verbs can have passive participles, of course). These participles are, of course, formed from the verb's present stem and the verb's past stem. 

In the present tense, the suffix used depends on the conjugation. Here is the list of suffixes:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>ACTIVE</th>
<th>PASSIVE</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>PRESENT</td>
<td><strong>ущ</strong>(ющ) , <strong>ащ</strong> (ящ)</td>
<td><strong>ом</strong>(ем) , <strong>им</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PAST</td>
<td><strong>ш</strong>, <strong>вш</strong></td>
<td><strong>нн</strong>(н), <strong>енн</strong>(ен), <strong>т</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Some examples: ид**у́щ**ий, ед**я́щ**ий, да**ю́щ**ий, говор**я́щ**ий, чита́**ющ**ий, чита́**ем**ый, чита́**вш**ий, прода**ю́щ**ий, прос**я́щ**ий, спра́шива**ющ**ий, купи́**вш**ий, ку́пл**енн**ый, прода́**вш**ий, про́да**нн**ый.

There are actual rules that cover which verbs get which past suffix. However, teaching the formation of an arbitrary participle would be an overkill for this particular course. At this level, it is enough that you are able to identify them.

Note that past passive participles ("a book that has been read") are only formed from perfective verbs in modern Russian.

### Short participles

Passive participles can be short, like adjectives, which is most useful for past participles. The agent, if needed, is in the Instrumental (and sounds quite formal):

*   Пла́тье (бы́ло) сде́лано в Кита́е. = The dress was made in China.
*   Э́та кни́га (была́) напи́сана в 1999 = This book was written in 1999.
*   Иллюстрация нарисована мной. = The illustration was drawn by me.


## Adverbial Participles

 An adverbial participle is a special form of the verb used to turn a verb into an adverb, you describe another action with it:

There are two types of adverbial participles in Russian:

*   **Imperfective:** "while doing"
*   **Perfective:** "having done"


English generally doesn't have these expressions as a one-word form. In Russian participles and adverbial participles are mostly used in books and when using a more formal style. However, there are a few popular adverbial participles that get used in speech sometimes.

*   Я рисовал горы и леса, думая о доме. = I drew mountains and forests, thinking about home.
*   Войдя в комнату, я включил свет. = Having entered the room, I switched the light on.


### Formation

Not every verb has a participle. Still, here are the rules.

**Imperfective** adverbial participles are formed by adding the suffix **-я** (or **а**) to the present stem:

*   входя, слушая, думая, включая, говоря
*   слыша


**Perfective** adverbial participles are formed by adding one of the suffixes **-в**, or **-вши**(obligatory for reflective verbs), **-ши** (for stems ending in a consonant) to the infinitive stem:

*   сделав, поняв, узнав, съев, выключив
*   вернувшись, побрившись


If the stem ends in **т** or **д**, **-я** is used instead:

*   найти → найдя
*   войти → войдя


Adverbial participles behave like adverbs, i.e. they only have one form.

### Set expressions

Some of these words have crystallized into popular expressions:

*   судя по = judging by
*   молча = silently
*   X лет спустя = X years later (bookish)


## Science

 *Ready to shoot for the stars? Get in! Of course, we cannot teach you all of the science in a handful of lessons. This skill focuses on popular scientific concepts like electiricity, analysis or atom. It also gives you a taste of some words typical of scientific and educational style, so that you do not feel lost if you ever read an article.*

### Како́в?

This bookish word is often used to ask about the identity of some property:

*   Какова́ суть пробле́мы? = What is the essense of the problem?
*   Какова́ ма́сса прото́на? = What is the mass of a proton?
*   Како́в разме́р вселе́нной? = What is the size of the universe?


«Како́й» *can* be used in some of these sentences with careful rewording but generally it will sound clumsy unless used for a numeric property:

*   Какова́ ма́сса мюо́на? ≃ Кака́я у мюо́на ма́сса?


### да́нные

"Data" is a plural-only word in Russian. Moreover, it is a nominalised adjective, so its endings are just like the ones adjectives have.

### при

This is, actually, one of the four prepositions normally used with the Prepositional case. It roughly means "in the presence of", which does not have a good match in English. In scientific context we often use it to describe conditions or circumstances:

*   

При э́той температу́ре газ бы́стро расширя́ется. = At that temperature, the gas expands rapidly.

*   

При увеличе́нии ма́ссы увели́чится и давле́ние. = If the mass is increased, the pressure will increase, too.

*   

При обы́чном давле́нии эффе́кт незаме́тен. = Under normal pressure, the effect is not noticeable.

### Short adjectives

Some predicate adjectives are used quite often in scientific writing and speech:

*   Вселе́нная огро́мна. = The Universe is enormous.
*   Вре́мя о́чень мало́. =  The time is very little.
*   Сопротивле́ние сли́шком велико́. = The resistance is too large.


## Politics and Government

### полиция / милиция

For a long time, «мили́ция» had been the word for Russian police. Then, during the 2009-2011 reform the name was changed to «поли́ция». The «милиционе́р» then becomes «полице́йский»

Still, expect native speakers to use *мили́ция* and *милиционе́р* in speech for quite a while. 

### выборы

"Election(s)" is always plural in Russian.

### являться

Russian has a formal verb «являться» which means "to be". The verb is reflexive. Its use is characteristic of formal writing and not necessary even there. 

However, there are some contexts where it is hard to do without it. For example, if you have a subordinate clause or a verb phrase where "to be" is the main verb (omitting it does not work weel in this case):

*   *A person **that is not a politician**, cannot understand this.* = Челове́к, **кото́рый не явля́ется поли́тиком**, не мо́жет э́того поня́ть. 


Or, well, you can use a participle if you are that formal. Here, you can also use a Dative impersonal construction, which means about the same (eg. «Ты никогда не смо́жешь поня́ть»→«Тебе́ никогда не поня́ть»):

*   Челове́к, не явля́ющийся поли́тиком, не мо́жет э́того поня́ть.
*   Челове́ку, не явля́ющемуся поли́тиком, э́того не поня́ть.


### премьер-министр

You can use either «премье́р-мини́стр» or a more colloquial word «премье́р» (which is behaves as a typical masculine noun) 

Officially, Russia has no position under the name of "prime minister", however, the *Chairman of the Govenment* is commonly called a prime minister in speech and in media. Which is why we teach it.


## Spiritual and Supernatural

### A few cultural notes

Russian has two words for **church**, «це́рковь» and «храм». 

**«Храм»** is a more generic term and is used in contexts where "temple" would usually be used in English. 

**«Це́рковь»**(church) is a Christian place of worship, and also means the organization itself. A smaller church building is more likely to be called «церковь», although the size is not the defining factor (this is determined by the number of altars and what the building has been traditionally called).

The Orthodox Church in Russia (and a few other countries) still uses the old Julian calendar for some of its celebrations. As of 2015, there is a 13-day difference between the Julian and the Gregorian (modern) calendar, so Christmas in Russia falls on **January 7**.

**«Бог»** is pronounced /бох/, which reflects the older pronunciation of the letter 'Г'. Its oblique forms are pronounced normally.

Salat, a Muslim religious practice conducted 5 times a day, is typically «нама́з» in Russian. It is not a prayer, by the way, which would be «дуа́».


## Some Spoken Patterns

 This skill gives you a glimpse of a few constructions common in speech and writing that are outside formal style. 

### не́ту

This word is the same as a predicative «нет», used in constructions of non-existence and not having:

*   У нас не́ту вре́мени! = We got no time!


### Ага́/Угу́

These are informal versions of affirmative "yes" (yep, yup). «Ага́» uses fricative sound, similar to *uh-huh*.  «Угу́» is actually pronounced the same way, just with your mouth closed, so its spelling is just an attempt to imitate that "mm-hmm" sound.

### )

While texting, Russian users often use smileys without the "eyes". If they are even more friendly than that or something is very funny, the number of brackets might skyrocket ))))))

### блин

There are many ways to say "Crap!" or "Jeez!" in Russian. Блин is, probably, the most common in speech while being rather mild (it is a substitute for a much stronger word). «Чёрт» is also very common and acceptable in a wide range of contexts (and it is not associated with more obscene words). It is what you will find in many movies and games, even those aimed at kids.


## Nothing Left

 This skill is about saying something like "I have nothing to fear" or "There is nothing to think about". Russian has special impersonal constructions to do just that; they make use of *negative predicate pronouns*. 

They are all formed by adding a stressed «не» to a corresponding question word, which should be either "who"/"what" or an adverbial question word (e.g., "where"). 

Use Dative to specify a person for whom this applies:

*   Мне не́чего чита́ть. = I have nothing to read.
*   Тут не́кого иска́ть. = There is no one to look for here.
*   Нам не́чего теря́ть. = We have nothing to lose.
*   Ей не́где спать. = She has nowhere to sleep.
*   Ва́не не с кем игра́ть. = Vanya has no one to play with.
*   Я ду́мал, э́той пробле́ме не́откуда взя́ться. = I had thought such a problem has nowhere to arise from. 


Note how the prepositions split pronouns formed from «кто» and «что». Only a few "simple" prepositions can do this, however:

*   Мне не с кем обща́ться. = I have no one to communicate with.
*   Не о чем беспоко́иться. = Nothing to worry about.
*   Не в чем вы́йти. = Nothing to wear to go out (about clothing).
*   Не на чем спать. = Nothing to sleep on.


It is also useful to stress that such pronouns are only formed from oblique forms of «кто» and «что», since they never act as a sentence subject. Words «не́кто» and «не́что» are not in this list; they actually behave as analogues of "кто-то" and "что-то" in their base forms, just of a higher style.

*P.S. «как» does not produce such a  pronoun. Neither do «почему́» and «како́й»*


## Crime and Justice

### proof and evidence

Usually when we are talking about a body of evidence proving something, it is plural «доказательства» (mathematical proof is still «доказательство»)

A piece of (material) evidence, a clue is also «улика». We do not teach it here but a useful word to know nonetheless.

### совершить

The verb «совершить» is the one you use to say someone "commited" a crime. In general language, it is also used in certain combinations like "to make a breakthrough" or "to make a discovery".

### тюрьма

After a criminal has been found guilty, he or she is often sent to or put in jail as a punishment. Russian uses the verb «посадить». Incidentally, this is the same verb that is used to say that you've planted a tree. Where English uses the verb 'to be', in Russian, a person «сидит в тюрьме», literally 'sits in jail'.
