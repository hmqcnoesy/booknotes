#Visual Studio Code

Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
to open the command palette,
which reveals all of Code's features.  The
`Ctrl-P` command allows you to search for a 
file and open it, like `Ctrl-,` in Visual Studio.
`Ctrl-P` then `>` is equivalent to `Ctrl-Shift-P`.

Use `code .` to open the current folder.  The
`-r` flag opens the file in the last active
instance of the Code application, and `-n`
forces a new instance of Code to be opened.
