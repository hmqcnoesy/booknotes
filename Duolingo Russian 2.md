## Partitive

 As you know, the Genitive case has *lots* of uses in Russian.

One of them expresses **an amount** of something:

*   чашка чая = a cup of tea 
*   тарелка риса = a plate of rice
*   корзина яблок = a basket of apples


With mass nouns it is also used to express "some" unspecified amount of that stuff when used instead of the Accusative:

*   Я хочу воды = I want (some) water.
*   Дайте, пожалуйста, риса. = Could I have some rice, please? (literally, "Give me, please, some rice").
*   Хочешь сока? = Want some juice?


Note that this usage is only characteristic for situations when you ask or hypothesize about using "some or other amount" of a substance. You cannot actually say that you are drinking "воды" right now—but you can say that you want some (or that you sipped some in the past—with a perfective¹, of course).

### чашка чаю

«Чай» has an alternative Partitive form «чаю»:

*   Хочешь чашечку чаю? = Want cup of tea?


It is optional. Actually, many short masculine nouns that denote substances used to have such form. However, «чай» is, probably, the only one where the form is immensely popular in spoken speech and does not sound old-fashioned or downright archaic.

* * *

###### ¹ Perfective is an *aspect*. Russian has verbs of two flavors: those that denote "processes" and those that mean "events" (events are never used in the present). I would argue that aspect is the main culprit for consumption verbs here. You can want "воды" forever, but you aren't *"drinking"* it at any specific moment. Semantically, "some" water only becomes a real amount when you are done, not while you are still at it.


## The Accusative: the Direct Object

### Accusative

Until now, you've been using the base form of the word in sentence like «Он ест **яблоко**».

Actually, whenever a verb, like "read", "cut" or "want" acts *directly* on some noun, the latter is a *direct object*. Such nouns take the Accusative case.

### Formation

Only feminine nouns ending in **-а** / **-я** have a separate form. «Мама» is a good example of this class :

*   ма́ма → ма́м**у**


Neuter nouns and feminine nouns with a final **-ь** (e.g., «мы́шь») use the Nominative form.

Now we are left with masculine nouns ending in a consonant (сок, медве́дь, брат). They use the same form as in Nominative or Genitive:

*   living beings ("animate") copy the Genitive 
*   objects  ("inanimate") stay Nominative
*   in plural this rule applies to all types of nouns

*With "substances"(mass nouns)* ***Genitive*** *may be used instead to convey a meaning of "some" quantity.*

###### Verbs that take a direct object are called *transitive*. Unfortunately, some verbs that are transitive in Russian are not transitive in English ("wait") and vice versa ("like").

### I want some

Russian has two main verb form patterns, which we are going to introduce soon. Unfortunately, the verb «хоте́ть»(to want) is irregular and mixes both. On a brighter note, it is a very common verb, so you'll memorize it eventually.

The other notable thing is that it does not have a strong connotation of 'need', unlike the English verb '"want". Similarly, the Russian verb for "give"(да́ть) is totally OK for polite requests. Just use it with «пожа́луйста».

*   *the one the 'giving' is directed towards is NOT a direct object in Russian. It is called an indirect object and takes the Dative. We'll deal with it later.*


## Verbs in the Present 1

### Е- and И- conjugation

The verbs in Russian change according to person and number. Each form has a different ending. There are only two patterns (apart from some phonetic changes). 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th />
<th>endings</th>
<th>Е- / И- examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>я</strong></td>
<td>-<strong>ю</strong> (у)</td>
<td>чита́ю, пишу́ / говорю́, ви́жу</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ты</strong></td>
<td>-<strong>ешь</strong> / -<strong>ишь</strong></td>
<td>чита́ешь, пи́шешь / говори́шь, ви́дишь</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>он/она́</strong></td>
<td>-<strong>ет</strong> / -<strong>ит</strong></td>
<td>чита́ет, пи́шет / говори́т, ви́дит</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td />
<td />
<td />
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>мы</strong></td>
<td>-<strong>ем</strong> / -<strong>им</strong></td>
<td>чита́ем, пи́шем / говори́м, ви́дим</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>вы</strong></td>
<td>-<strong>ете</strong> / -<strong>ите</strong></td>
<td>чита́ете, пи́шете / говори́те, ви́дите</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>они́</strong></td>
<td>-<strong>ют</strong>(ут) / -<strong>ят</strong> (ат)</td>
<td>чита́ют, пи́шут / говоря́т, ви́дят</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


We will learn these one by one. There are only **four** irregular stems. The verbs *хоте́ть, дать, есть, бежа́ть* and all their derivatives do not strictly follow any of the 2.

Note that if the endings are stressed, Ё replaces Е. Fortunately, a non-past form has only 2 options:

*   fixed stress – on the stem (чита́ю, чита́ете, ви́жу, ви́дит) or on the ending  (стою́, стои́т, стои́шь)
*   "я"-form is has a stressed ending (Я пишу́). The stress is on the stem in the other forms (ты пи́шешь, она пи́шет..)


*A verb uses one stem to form Infinitive and Past tense forms. It uses the 2nd one, similar, for non-past and imperative. Thus, as a rule you cannot predict all forms from the infinitive. You can make a guess, though.*

### Meals

In this course we use the American English definitions:

*   **за́втрак** = *breakfast*, a morning meal
*   **обе́д** = *lunch*, a midday meal
*   **у́жин** = *dinner*, an evening meal


## The Infinitive, Likes and Dislikes

### I like/I love ?

In Russian, you can express liking things and activities pretty much the same way as in English, with similar verbs. The usage differs a bit, though.

A a rule of thumb, **«Я люблю́»** means *"I love"* only when directed at a single person (or animal). Otherwise, it's just "I like".

*   "LOVE" **люби́ть** means a stable, lasting feeling (note the phonetic change for the 1st person singular: "люблю"). A normal, transitive verb, i.e. used with the Accusative. Use it for ***loving*** an individual or *liking some things/people/activity in general* (verbs take infinitive). Very much preferred in negations of such activities (i.e. "don't like to wait")
*   

"LIKE" **нра́виться** means moderate "liking" something or someone, often something specific. Not transitive! The thing liked is the subject, acting indirectly on a person: «Мне нра́вится стол» = *I like the table.*

*   

note that «Мне нра́вится стол» works in a similar way to the English verb "to seem": *"The table seems good to me"*. The sentence is built as though the table "transmits" the feeling towards you. While rare in English, in Russian, this is pretty typical for feelings and experience to be expressed that way («Мне хорошо́»). 

###### Infinitive «нра́виться» and 3rd person singular «нра́вится» are pronounced exactly the same, however, for the sake of consistency they are spelt differently (most infinitives end in «-ть», so -ть + ся = -ться, naturally)

When you refer to generic things and activities, both verbs can be used but «люби́ть» is mildly more useful. 

### May I?

Possibility and/or permission are often expressed with words **мо́жно** and **нельзя́**. 

*   Здесь мо́жно жить. = One may live here.
*   Здесь нельзя́ есть. = One cannot/should not eat here.


The English translation may vary. You can specify the person for whom the permission or recommendation applies, in the Dative (but you do not have to):

*   Мне нельзя́ спать. = I should not sleep.
*   Нам нельзя́ мно́го есть. = We should not eat a lot.


P.S.  the **-ся** at the end of "нра́вится" is a reflexive particle and comes after the ending (in verbs, use *-сь* after a vowel, *-ся* after a consonant) . Technically, a reflexive verb is one where the subject of the verb acts on itself. As you can see, often this is not always reflected clearly in the meaning. «Нра́виться» is one of those verbs that are reflexive "just because". 

Don't worry about it too much for now, as we'll be tackling reflexives in more detail further down the tree.


## Food

### Yummy

> «для»(for) always takes Genitive nouns

Food offers a delicious intake of mass nouns. Russian has them massed up even where English does not!

*   so **карто́шка**(potatoes), **лук**(onions), **шокола́д** are mass nouns in Russian
*   and you may recall that mass nouns may be used in Gen. instead of Acc. if you mean "some quantity": *Купи́ сы́ра/карто́шки.* = Buy some cheese/potatoes.


### 'Taters

The formal word for potato is **карто́фель** (German speakers, rejoice), but it's hardly ever used in speech. Use «карто́шка» instead.

The word for tomato is **помидо́р**. There is also the word **тома́т**, but it is

*   the plant's name, pretty formal; look on pricetags
*   

the base stem for derivative products: *тома́тная па́ста = tomato paste*

*   

**посуда** is a word for different containers used for cooking , consuming and further storage of food.  English, sadly, does not have the exact equivalent. However, it is obviously "dishes" that you wash and "cookware/tableware" that you buy.

### Verbal wisdom

In this skill, we used *perfective* verbs for "cook", "cut", "wash". The reason is simple: that's the verb you'd use when you want a *single specific* action, often with a result—rather than referring to "activity" (activity may be fun but, in some cases, pointless).

More on that later. For now, just go with the flow.


## Adjectives Basics and Spelling

 In Russian adjectives *agree* with the nouns they modify in gender/number and case. Out of 24 combinations only 12 forms are different. This system is completely regular, with no change of stress. The endings have “hard” and “soft” variants depending on the stem (for example, ый/ий or “ая/яя”). 

**Here is the Nominative and Genitive** for “classic” hard- and soft-stem adjectives ("new"/"blue"):

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th />
<th>NOM</th>
<th>GEN</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>fem</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ая</strong>/си́н<strong>яя</strong> чашка</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ой</strong>/си́н<strong>ей</strong> ча̒шки</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>masc</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ый</strong>/си́н<strong>ий</strong> дом</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ого</strong>/си́н<strong>его</strong> до́ма</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>neut</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ое</strong>/си́н<strong>ее</strong> окно́</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ого</strong>/си́н<strong>его</strong> окна</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pl.</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ые</strong>/си́н<strong>ие</strong> ча́шки</td>
<td>но́в<strong>ых</strong>/си́н<strong>их</strong> ча́шек</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


note that *masculine* and *neuter* merge in all their forms different from the Nominative one (their Accusative will be the same as the Gen. or the Nom. depending on animacy).  In the Nominative there is also -ОЙ masculine ending: **большо́й** (“big”). Only for ending-stressed adjectives.

*   ОГО/ЕГО are historical spellings: **г** actually sounds like [**в**]
*   unstressed -ая(яя) /-ое (ее) sound identical in standard Russian: *си́няя* and *си́нее* have no difference in pronunciation.


The following universal rules of Russian spelling will give you the rest of the endings for any adjective you ever meet (there exist 4 patterns at most):

*   After **Г-К-Х** (“velars”) and **Ш-Щ-Ж-Ч** (“hushes”) use **И** and never *Ы*
*   After **Ц , Г-К-Х** (“velars”) and **Ш-Щ-Ж-Ч** (“hushes”) use **А, У** and never *Я, Ю*
*   After **Ц** and **Ш-Щ-Ж-Ч** (“hushes”) use **Е** *when unstressed* and never *О*.


## Conjunctions

### а vs. и

In Russian, **и** is used to show similarity. Otherwise you should use **а**, which shows *contrast*. To be more specific, here are the typical patterns:

*   Я мальчик, а ты девочка. = I am a boy and you are a girl.
*   Я работаю в кафе, а ты в школе. = I work in a cafe, and you (work) in a school.
*   Я люблю спать, а ты нет. = I like sleeping, and you don't.
*   А ты? = And you? → often used to indicate a question.


### зато (*negative*, зато *positive*)

A conjunction used for "compensating" for something unpleasant with something that, you imply, is good:

*   У нас нет молока, зато есть хлеб = *We don't have milk but we do have bread*.
*   Мальчик ещё не умеет писать, зато хорошо читает. = *The boy cannot write yet but he reads well*.


Not exactly the best thing to translate into English (*"on the other hand"? "but at least"? "thankfully?"*), so it is not often used in this course.

### хотя ('though')

Much like the English *though/even though/although*. It is often combined with "и" before the predicate (which is sometimes directly after «хотя»):

*   Он здесь, хотя (он) и не знает ничего.= Он здесь, хотя (он) ничего и не знает. = He is here, even though he doesn't know anything. 


### как

This conjunction has a rather interesting use, to show when someone perceives someone else's action:

*   Я ви́жу, как она́ танцу́ет. = I see her dancing.
*   Они́ слу́шают, как музыка́нт игра́ет. = They listen to the musician playing.


* * *

*For **а**, there is also "narrative" contrast pattern, largely absent from this course (but not from real-life Russian):*

*   На столе чашка, а в чашке чай. = *There is a cup on the table, and the cup has tea in it*.
*   Он здесь, а это значит — воды нет. = *He is here, and that means there's no water*.
*   Такси — это машина, а машины не всегда хорошо работают. = *A taxi is a car, and cars do not always work well.* (here, you are making your point by introducing a new thought "unexpected" by a listener)


## There is

### Word order

To say "there is/are" in Russian, do the following:

*   say THE PLACE
*   then the verb (if any)
*   then THE OBJECT


«есть» is not used, unless the sentence really has to emphasize the existence of the object.  Some examples:

*   На столе́ ло́жка. = There is a spoon on the table.
*   На сту́ле ма́льчик. = There is a boy on the chair.
*   В до́ме никого́ нет. = There is no one in the house.
*   На столе́ лежи́т ко́шка. = A cat is lying on the table.


In the Present tense no verb is necessary; in the past, you would at least need a form of "to be". Note that even in the present Russian still uses verbs like "is situated", "stands", "lies" way more often than would be considered normal in English. 

The most natural translation into English is a structure like "There is an apple on the table" or "An apple is on the table". The emphasis is on the object, not on the place.

*Actually, such a sentence answers the question of WHAT is in the said place. For out-of-the-blue sentences about objects that have nothing unique about them it matches what English THERE-IS sentences are for. So this is what we have in this course.*

### Actions

The initial position of a "place" inside the sentence holds for many other structures, too. Whenever the place is not a part of the "message" of your sentence, it is usually somewhere at the beginning (that is, if the place frames your description of an action rather than providing crucial information).

If the whole point of uttering a sentence is telling someone about the place then, naturally, it takes the sentence-final position:

*   За́втра я в Нью-Йо́рке. = I am in New York tomorrow. (not somewhere else)


### lies/stands

You don't have to translate verbs like "to stand" and "to lie" literally when they refer to objects. Such use is not, by a wide margin, nearly as standard in English as it is in Russian:

*   На столе́ стои́т ча́шка. = *A cup is ("stands") on the table.*


In English "to be" is perfectly fine, so we accept that.


## Questions

### Where

Russian makes a distinction between being somewhere (тут/здесь, там) , going there (сюда, туда) and coming *from* there (отсюда, оттуда)—so naturally question words follow suit:

*   Где? = Where (at)?
*   Куда? = Where to?
*   Откуда? = Where from?


### What or what are you?

Russian uses **«Кто»**(who) when asking about identity and occupation and «Что» is used for objects rather than people. Since Russian nouns have cases, **кто** and **что** also change depending on their role in the implied sentence. As you will discover a little bit further down the tree, «Кто» behaves rather like a masculine adjective.

### Почему? and Зачем?

*   **Почему** is used when asking a question about a cause of some event or action. It is a question that looks back at the past.
*   **Зачем** starts a question about the **purpose** of some action or some event that can have one. It is a question that looks towards a desired future.


In a few regions of Russia (Tatarstan, for example)  people may use *зачем* for both questions if their  usage of Russian is influenced by a major local language that makes no distinction between the two. In Standard Russian these are two clearly separate entities.


## People 1

### Vocabulary

*   **директор** is usually the main boss, akin to CEO in English. Also the Principal or Head Teacher of a school.
*   **ученик** is a school student or a "follower" or "disciple" of some "teacher" in a more spiritual sense. AmE speakers may confuse it with "студент", which is strictly a college-level student.
*   **коллега** is your first word of *common* gender, i.e. its gender depends on who you are referring to.


## Around you

### Do that the English way

To express the idea of speaking some language, or something being written in that language, Russian has adverbs literally meaning "Russian-ly", "English-ly" etc.. :

*   Я не говорю́ по-ру́сски. = I do not speak Russian.
*   Вы говори́те по-англи́йски. = Do you speak English?


They are formed from **-ский** adjectives by attaching **по-** and changing the tail to bare **-ски**: по-ру́сски, по-италья́нски, по-япо́нски, по-вьетна́мски, по-америка́нски, по-францу́зски and so on.

And remember, these words actually mean something done "in a certain way", so «суши по-американски» (American-style sushi) should not surprise you!

### Locative 2

A relatively small group of short masculine nouns have an accented **-у** ending with *в/на* in the meaning of place (and only then):

*   Мы в **аэропорту́**. = We are at the airport.
*   Я сплю́ на **полу́**. = I sleep on the floor.


Our course has about a dozen of them (there are about 100 in the language). Also, there exists a very small group of feminine nouns, all "-ь"-ending, that have a stressed Locative-2 ending:

*   Твой сви́тер в **крови́**. = Your sweater is covered in blood.


All these nouns use their normal Prepositional form with "о" and "при".

#### совсе́м

This word is used with qualities that manifest "totally"— usually with negatives:

*   Он совсе́м не рабо́тает. = He doesn't work at all.
*   Том совсе́м не ест. = Tom doesn't eat at all.
*   Мы совсе́м бли́зко. = We are really close (i.e. almost there).


#### междунаро́дный

It comes from «ме́жду» + «наро́ды», i.e. "between"+"peoples", which is quite literally "international". 

The loanword «интернациональный» means the same but has quite limited use in certain combinations like "international team" or "international debt" (mostly these are from political contexts). This course largely avoids this word.

Probably, "international team/orchestra" etc. is the context where you must use «интернациональный»).

#### живо́тное

The word for an "animal" is a nominalised neuter adjective, and its case forms follow adjectival pattern. Of course, its gender is fixed:

*   Это живо́тные. = These are animals.
*   Я люблю́ живо́тных. = I like animals.


## Prepositions and Places

### Verbs of motion

Russian distinguishes between "going" on foot and by some sort of vehicle. If you aren't moving within the city, use a 'vehicle verb' **ехать** (one-way movement) or **ездить** (repeated, round trip or in general). More on that later, in "Motion verbs".

### Into/onto... at-to?

Once again, with **в** and **на** you use Prepositional for *location*, and Accusative for *direction*:

*   Я живу́ в *Ло́ндоне*. ~ I live in London.
*   Я е́ду в *Ло́ндон*. ~ I am going (by vehicle) to London.


Here is a 'cheat sheet' of forms you'll need for places (no living beings, so—the easy Accusative for masculine):

<td><strong>-ие</strong></td>

<td>здание → в здание / в здании</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Word choice

For "outdoors" Russians use **«на улице»** (literally, "on the street").

The preposition **о** (об) means "about" only as in the sense of "thinking/writing about". Don't use it for "approximately". With «*мне*» a special form is used, **обо**.

The contraction "USA" or "the U.S." is **США** (сэ-шэ-А, with the stress on the last vowel).

There is no difference drawn between "city" and "town".

In Russian it is typical to describe objects as "standing", "lying", "being situated", "hanging". This is rare in English, and often sounds unnatural, therefore in this course it is perfectly OK to translate a "whereabouts"-verb with a simple "is", "was" etc.

### Here and there, and here

For "here", the words **здесь** and **тут** are almost completely interchangeable in any imaginable context. **Тут** is considered a bit more informal, and is used in set expressions ( тут же~right away, тут и там). «Здесь» is somewhat less suitable for figurative meanings (when by "here" you mean the current situation rather than a place). In this course, they are completely interchangeable when not being used in a set expression.

**находиться** is a verb to denote the whereabouts of things, and, sometimes of people (when the emphasis is on exactly where they are). It could be translated as "to be situated" or "to be located", but as these verbs usually sound rather formal in English, so you can just use "to be".

**около** is almost the same as «возле». It can also be used in the sense of "about"(=approximately).


## Verbs Present 2

### → and ⇆

There are two options for verbs of **going**: a specific 1-directional verb and also repeated motion, multi-directional verb. For now, stick to this rule for **идти́ / ходи́ть**:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th />
<th>ENG</th>
<th>RUS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>right now</strong>→</td>
<td>I <em>am going</em>.</td>
<td>Я <strong>иду́</strong>.→</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>habitual</em> ⇆</td>
<td>I often <em>go</em> there.</td>
<td>Я ча́сто туда́ <strong>хожу́</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>generic</em> ↝↶↺</td>
<td>The baby already <em>walks</em>. I <em>am walking</em> (around).</td>
<td>Ребёнок уже́ <strong>хо́дит</strong>. Я <strong>хожу́</strong>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Asking

*   **проси́ть** → to ask for/beg for/request something 
*   **спра́шивать** → to ask a question (i.e. ask for information) 


In other words, when using *про́сит*, one wants to be given something (or for something to be done). He who *спра́шивает*–wants an answer.

By the way, "to ask a question" is, actually, «*зада́ть/задава́ть* вопро́с». Those who speak German may recall *eine Frage stellen*, which works in a similar way (apparently, "to ask an asking" is no good in German, either).

### Negative sentences

Remember that Russian sort of uses double and triple negatives. To be more precise, it is coordinated negation: when the sentence is negative, you should automatically negate every pronoun referring to *someone*, *anywhere*, *some time*, *anything*, *in some way* and so on:

*   Мы никогда́ нику́да ни с кем не ходи́м = We never go anywhere with anyone (Literally, "We never to nowhere with nobody don't go"). 


They all change to *nobody, nowhere, never, nothing, by no means* and so on. *No one* and *nothing* will have the correct case (though, "nothing" is virtually always *ничего*, not *ничто*)

### Adverbs

The typical position for **-о**(-е)-ending adverbs is *before* the verb. For example:

*   «Он хорошо́ види́т»="He sees well".
*   «Том бы́стро ушёл»="Tom left quickly"


### Consonant mutation.

You might have noticed that the consonant before the ending is sometimes different in the infinitive than in the personal forms. It is called *mutation* and is quite similar to the process that makes  "tense" into "tension" (where an "s" turns into a "sh"). Here are the patterns you might encounter:

*   Б, П, В, Ф, М adding **л** (люби́ть / люблю́)
*   С, Х becoming **ш** (писа́ть / пишу́)
*   Д, З  becoming **ж** (ви́деть / ви́жу)
*   Т, К becoming **ч** (плати́ть / плачу́)
*   СК, СТ becoming Щ (пусти́ть / пущу́)


If there is alteration, there is a rule:

*   **И-conjugation verbs** only have 1st person singular mutated. It is normal (e.g. люблю / любит)
*   **Е-conjugation verbs** have mutation in ALL personal forms (if any). It is *non-productive behaviour*, which in practice means that a lot of popular verb stems still have this behavior (e.g. писать, сказать). However, new Е-conjugation verbs  do not get this pattern.


###### рисовать → рисую, on the other hand, is a regular transformation of -овать/-евать verbs

### Playing

The verb «играть» is used as follows:

*   **в** + Accusative for games
*   **на** + Prepositional for musical instruments


For example, Я игра́ю в футбо́л / Я игра́ю на гита́ре.
