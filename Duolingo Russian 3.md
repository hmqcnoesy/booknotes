## Time and Numbers

 ### Using numbers with nouns

Let's focus on the Nominative for now (this also works when Acc.=Nom). Russian numbers may seem a bit weird. The case of the noun depends on the last word of the number:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>last word</th>
<th align="center">means</th>
<th>Case</th>
<th align="center">example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>оди́н *(одна́, одно́, одни́ )*</td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td>Nom. sg.</td>
<td align="center">оди́н дом, одна́ ма́ма, два́дцать одно́ окно́, оди́н сто́л</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>два *(две)*, три, четы́ре</td>
<td align="center">2, 3, 4</td>
<td>Gen. sg.</td>
<td align="center">две ко́шки, два стола́, три ма́льчика, три́дцать четы́ре стола́</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Larger than that</td>
<td align="center">5, 6, 12, 100 etc.</td>
<td>Gen. pl.</td>
<td align="center">пять ко́шек, пять ма́льчиков, два́дцать пять ко́шек, миллио́н ко́шек</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Just like English, Russian has words for *eleven through nineteen*, so they fall into the "larger" category. 

**Genitive plural** has a rather bizarre set of patterns, so a separate skill latern on will teach you how to make it for most nouns.

### Expressions

*   *I am 10 (years old)* = Мне де́сять (лет) Note the Dative "мне" and the number in the Nominative. The Genitive plural "лет" is irregular.


The Dative forms of он, она and они are ему, ей, им respectively.

*   *at 9 (o'clock)* = в де́вять (часо́в) → the Accusative here (same as the Nominative)
*   *at 2 in the morning* = в два (часа́) но́чи (in Russian 'morning' starts at about 4-5 a.m.)
*   *in March, June. etc.* = в январе́, ию́не ... (Prepositional). Note that all the month names are masculine nouns.
*   the beginning/end of July = нача́ло/коне́ц ию́ля


* * *

Why are Russian numbers so strange? Well, for 2-3-4 these are the remnants of Dual number (which is between the singular and the plural). As for the larger numbers, they are essentially "nouns": *a heap of cats, a lot of cats, a thousand... of cats*.


## Family

 Not much to say here, except that Russian does not have a special word for *siblings* or *grandparents*.

Unlike English, Russians rarely say "my mother", "my grandfather"; usually they omit "my".

### **свой** ~ one's own

...And when they don't, it is more natural to use reflexive "свой" (one's own). English does not have anything quite like that. Essentially, it is a substitute for *my, your, his, her* etc. that you use when it refers to the person (or thing) that is the subject of the sentence or, at least, the clause you are in. A few typical examples:

*   Кошка ест из *своей* миски = The cat is eating out of *its* bowl.
*   Мы у *(своих)* родителей = We are at *our* parents' place. (here you can omit "своих")
*   Я думаю, он у *своих* родителей = I think he's at *his* parents' place.


Forms of «свой» follow the same mostly-adjectival pattern that «мой»,«твой», «ваш», «наш» and «этот» use: свой, своя, своё, свои → своего, свою, своих...

Since «свой» describes something belonging to the subject of the sentence, it cannot be used with the subject of the sentence itself. The exception is made when you are making generalisations, e.g. "One's (own) reputation is always more important"~«Своя репутация всегда важнее».

Pay attention to what the *grammatical subject* is. Sentences like «Мне нравится у своей сестры» are sort-of-OK sometimes, but you are really treading on thin ice here. This one sounds almost normal, while some others would immediately look unnatural.

### Mister!

In spoken Russian «дядя»(uncle) and «тётя»(aunt) are often used to refer to some adult "guy" or "woman". A special case is children's use, since they often use it even as a form of address ("тётя Маша!"). 

This course doesn't cover this. But it's still useful to know.


## People 2

 ### A student

Russian has different words for a school student (aka *a pupil*, BrE) and a college-level student, which both have masculine and feminine versions:

*   **учени́к / учени́ца** – a school student or a student/apprentice in general, especially in spiritual sense
*   **студе́нт / студе́нтка** – a college or university-level student (attends a corresponding institution)


**Молоде́ц** is a word you use when someone "did a good job". It comes with a patronizing shade, so ideally you use it towards your friends or actual students/ subordinates (but not towards people whose work you are in no position to judge).

### 5 men

When you are counting people, use "челове́к" for numbers that end in «пять» (5) or more. Anywhere else use the normal Genitive plural "люде́й" (with *много* and *мало* both are possible, but I'd stick to *люде́й*).

### Learning and studying

###### OK, Russian has a number of ways to express learning, but in this course we have **учи́ться**, **учи́ть**, and **занима́ться**. The 1st verb, **учи́ться**, is introduced in this skill. Here is a bit more:


<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th />
<th align="center">meaning</th>
<th align="center">examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>**учи́ться**</td>

<td align="center">to teach somebody something</td>
<td align="center">Я учу́ студе́нтов ру́сскому.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Doctor

###### The usual word for a (medical) doctor is «**врач**». Then you have «до́ктор», which is also OK but informal. However, a "doctor" as a person with this level of post-graduate qualification is «до́ктор» with no alternatives.


## Weather and Nature

 ### It's raining

"To go" is the verb used for precipitation in Russian:

*   Идёт дождь = It is raining.
*   Идёт снег. = It is snowing.
*   Идёт град. = it is hailing *(we don't have that)*.


### in summer/winter

Russian has adverbs for "in spring", "in summer" etc. They are formed as the *Instrumental* case of a corresponding noun. 

We'll cover Intrumental in detail later. Right now just get used to the words themselves:

*   Весно́й мо́кро. = It's wet in spring
*   Зимо́й хорошо́ = It's good/nice in winter.
*   О́сенью гря́зно. = It's muddy in the fall.
*   Ле́том со́лнечно. = It is sunny in summer.


###### Russians usually assign each season 3 months, i.e. winter is December through February and spring is March through May (even if you have snow well into April).

### Category of State

Easier than it sounds. When expressing a "state", some modality or one's opinion on the situation, Russian often uses these *impersonal* words, saying that such and such state is observed:

*   Мне *хо́лодно*. = I'm (feeling) cold.
*   На ули́це *тепло́*. = It is warm outside.
*   *Хорошо́*, что вы тут. = It is good you are here.
*   *Тру́дно* сказа́ть. = It is hard to say.


Many are homonymous with adverbs and short-form adjectives. So we'll study them later with adjectives. For now, we' only have a handful of such words useful when discussing the weather.

Needless to say, these do not use any grammatical subject and are quite useful with verbs like "to be" and "to become" ("It's getting warmer").

###### The concept of "category of state" is not even taught to native speakers. However, it does have a distinctive pattern of use. Makes it easier to learn when you know why you say «мне хо́лодно».


## Sport

 ### win/lose

Here you encounter two *perfective* verbs; these two very obviously refer to a specific result:

*   Ты проигра́л! = You lost!
*   Нам надо вы́играть. = We need to win.


Note the formation of the past. If you remember *был, была́*—all Russian past forms are essentially formed the same way. The endings correspond to gender and number:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">**masc**</th>
<th align="center">**fem**</th>
<th align="center">**neut**</th>
<th align="center">**pl**</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">—</td>
<td align="center">**-а**</td>
<td align="center">**-о**</td>
<td align="center">**-и**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


We'll be practising many more past forms in the skill in the next row.

### Reflexive

As a reminder, if a verb has **-ся** at the end, you stick it after the usual ending («-сь» is used after a vowel):

*   ката́ться на лы́жах = to ski
*   Я ката́юсь на лы́жах = I ski.


### «бежа́ть», to run

In this skill, we introduce the one-way verb "to run". You may not remember but it has one of the four irregular stems:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">SING.</th>
<th align="center">PLUR.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">Я **бегу́**</td>
<td align="center">Мы бежи́м</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Ты бежи́шь</td>
<td align="center">Вы бежи́те</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Он бежи́т</td>
<td align="center">Они **бегу́т**</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Adjectives 1

 In Russian the adjective *agrees* with the noun it modifies in gender(number) and case. Fortunately, the system is *completely* regular and the stress stays the same. The forms for the cases you know are: 

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">**ENDINGS**</th>
<th align="center">masculine</th>
<th align="center">neuter</th>
<th align="center">feminine</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">Nom.</td>
<td align="center">**-ый(о́й)/-ий **</td>
<td align="center">**-ое/-ее**</td>
<td align="center">**-ая/-яя**</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Acc.</td>
<td align="center">Nom. or Gen.</td>
<td align="center">-ое/-ее</td>
<td align="center">-ую/-юю</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Gen.</td>
<td align="center">-ого/-его</td>
<td align="center">see masc.</td>
<td align="center">-ой/-ей</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Prep.</td>
<td align="center">-ом/-ем</td>
<td align="center">see masc.</td>
<td align="center">-ой/-ей</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


The plural ending in the Nominative is **-ые (ие)**. We will address the oblique forms later in the course.

###### (we are not teaching possessive adjectives for now, )

A few examples:

*   Я живу в большом городе. (Prep.,masc.)
*   Дайте большого кота. (Acc.,masc.)
*   Нам надо найти хорошую книгу. (Acc.,fem)


### velars and hushes

Adjectives with the stem on **-к, -г, -х, -ш, -щ, -ж, -ч** will use "и", "а", "у" instead of "ы", "я", "ю" so watch carefully ("русский", for instance).

We will tackle the endings one at a time.

### целый vs. весь

In Russian the idea of "the whole" of something can be expressed by either «целый» or «весь». The former is used when implying the unexpectedly "large" amount; it is the one we're teaching in this skill:

*   Он целый день спит. (normally, a person should have been awake for a long time)


## Past & Infinitive

 ### The infinitive stem

In Russian the Past tense and the Infinitive are formed from the same stem.

The forms are actually much easier than in the Present because there are only four forms in total for *masculine/feminine/neuter + plural*, similar to adjectives (the forms were participles once).

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>VERB</th>
<th align="center">**masc**</th>
<th align="center">**fem**</th>
<th align="center">**neut**</th>
<th align="center">**pl**</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td align="center">е́ло</td>
<td align="center">е́ли</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


«идти» and all its derivatives (пойти́, прийти́, найти́..) has a strange, irregular past stem:

**walked, went**: он пошёл, она пошл**а́**, оно пошл**о́**, они пошл**и́**

For the masculine form, there is a phonetic simplification for verbs with infinitives in *-чь,-сти/-зти, -зть/-сть*. For example “мочь”(“can”), “ползти́”(crawl) and “лезть”(climb): *он **мог, полз, лез*** —  no  final **Л** here.

This skill mostly covers the past form of imperfective verbs (only «уста́ть» and «подожда́ть» are perfective). What it means for you is that when 2 or more such actions are mentioned, they were all happening at the same time or in no particular order. Why? Imperfective verbs like «идти́», «жить», «говори́ть» are by nature unspecific about their exact timeframe.

*   they express repeated or prolonged action
*   action in progress
*   the fact that an action has or has not occured (with or without details on "when" it took place).


### What about the present form?

For some verb types the two stems are nearly identical (понима́ть, говори́ть). Which is a good thing for you!


## Shopping

 ### Give me that!

By now, you have probably noticed a surprising lack of "that one" in Russian. The thing is, Russian mostly uses "этот" both for "this" and "that", unless you need to make a contrast between "this one here" and "that one there". 

However, when you are really pointing at things, use whatever you like! 

*   «вот тут»~right here;«вот э́тот» ~ "this one here"
*   «вон там»~over there; «вон тот» ~ "that one over there"


("вот" is acceptable with both)

### Clothing

*   **оде́жда** is a mass noun for "clothes", **о́бувь** for footwear. 
*   **ту́фли** are also "shoes", but a more specific kind: "dress shoes" or the shoes you'd use with a gown
*   **боти́нок** ...a dictionary will say it's a bit higher than a "dress shoe". In reality, especially in men's speech, the word is often used for shoes, too
*   **сапо́г** is most definitely a boot
*   **пальто́** is typically a long outer garment
*   **ку́ртка** is more generic but usually refers to a shorter outer garment—with proportions not much different from a shirt
*   **руба́шка** is the word used for shirt. «Соро́чка» is a formal word for a shirt that is worn as a part of a suit (eg. with pants, a jacket and a necktie), but people still use "руба́шка" anyway. 


### a bigger/smaller shirt

From the **Adjectives** skill you might remember «бо́льше» and «меньше» as words for "more/bigger" and "less/fewer/smaller". Since these work as adverbs, it is problematic to use them with nouns. 

Instead, the words **«побо́льше» / «поме́ньше»** are used AFTER a noun:

*   Я хочу́ стол побо́льше/поме́ньше.
*   Да́йте я́блоко побо́льше.


This works with some other popular adjectives: подлинне́е, покоро́че, полу́чше. When not used with nouns directly, these have a colloquial quality.

Actually, with adjectives other than *большо́й/мале́нький* you may resort to «бо́лее дли́нное пальто́». However, «бо́лее большо́е»? No. Just no.


## Dative and Plurals

 ### The Dative Case in Russian

You have already seen that many **expressions of feelings and experience** use the Dative: *”Мне нра́вится...”, “Ма́ме хорошо́”, “Ему́ 5 лет”, “Мне ка́жется ...”* etc. 

The Dative introduces an ***indirect object*** of an action: usually the person whom the action is directed towards. An example would be a sentence like “I handed a package to *my mom*”: “my mom” here is a recipient. 

Actually, this depends on the verb, just like in English. Some popular verbs of speech, writing or “giving” will use the bare Dative for the recipient: ***говори́ть, сказа́ть, писа́ть, чита́ть, дать, принести́*** and so on.

### Dative prepositions

*   **по**: the basic meaning is “movement along the surface”("covering" it) which may realise as “walking around the park”, “running down the street”, “looking for it all over the house” etc. 
*   **к**: towards, to. Often used when you are going towards somebody (“towards Anna” = «к Анне»)
*   several bookish prepositional phrases like «благодаря́» (thanks to) or «вопреки́» (contrary to)


**По** has an additional meaning, “apiece” or "each" : «Они́ взя́ли по три я́блока»=”They took 3 apples each”.

###### There is a bookish use of «по» meaning "upon". It goes with Prepositional, and is mostly used in set prepositional phrases like «по оконча́нии» (upon completion).

### Cases in plural

Plurals have only **one pattern** shared by all nouns (e.g., «я говорю́ о дома́х, стра́нах, города́х, я́блоках, дочеря́х»). Only the Nominative and (especially) the Genitive have a number of variants


## Speaking 1

 ### Sequence of tenses in Russian

There is no sequence of tenses in Russian whatsoever.

The information in a subordinate sentence is understood  to be relative to the main clause:

*   Он сказа́л, что не зна́ет. = *He said he didn't know.*


So if the piece of information is simply about where things are or what someone does, use present tense in the subordinate clause.

### ли

Use the particle "ли" in reported questions or situations when you don't know which option is true:

*   Я спроси́л, зна́ет ли он Москву́. =* I asked him if he knew Moscow*.
*   Мы не зна́ем, бу́дет ли он в о́фисе. = *We don't know whether he is going to show up in the office*.


###### The particle is attached to the word that is in doubt.It needn't be verb, for instance, «Я не зна́ю, в Москве́ ли он» (i.e. whether he is in Moscow or in some other city).

### Talk or say?

The verb *говори́ть* is used both as "to say, to tell" and as "to talk, to speak". When you report someone's words, obviously, the 2nd meaning is in action:

*   Она говори́т, что хо́чет спать. = She says that she wants to sleep.


Russian has a whole set of **perfective** verbs. The thing is, usually you arrange verbs neatly into closely matching pairs of *imperfective + perfective*. And these are different for the two meanings of «говори́ть»:

*   to say → говори́ть / сказ́ать
*   to speak → говори́ть / поговори́ть


Remember «Скажи́те, пожа́луйста ... » ?

Rather than referring to ongoing actions or past(future) actions in general, perfective verbs refer to actions in a point-wise manner, ignoring the action's inner structure. That is, such "singular" actions happen at some particular "moment" and can be conveniently arranged in a sequence when telling a story.  This distinction is about to come into focus in one of the following skills.


## Perfective Verbs -1

 ### Aspect in Russian

Verbs in Russian come in two 'flavours' : *perfective* (eg. “пригото́вить”) and *imperfective* (eg. “гото́вить”). 

Let's get this straight right away: their forms are formed in the same way.

**Perfective** verbs mean an action, an "event" linked to a point in time. Sometimes, a presence of a result. You use them for sequences of actions, too. 

**Imperfective** verbs are used for everything else: processes, states, repeated actions and for generic reference to an action (when the time of occurence is irrelevant).

In this introductory lesson we deal with the most basic pattern of use: 

*   **perfective verbs** are used to tell stories about **successive** actions
*   imperfectives are used for *simultaneous* processes
*   **perfective verbs** are often used to describe *single* actions that have a specific result, e.g., “Give me that”, “I bought some food”, “I have painted many pictures”. However, not all of them can be reliably described like that.
*   use imperfective to tell that you have or have never done something, especially in "out of the blue" situations. When the action was *supposed* to be done (which is known by listener), use the perfective. 


### Morphology

Being too lazy to make up many different verbs, we usually make new ones based on the old ones. The vast majority of unprefixed verbs are imperfective.

*   **Prefixation** is the main method to create a perfective verb: *писа́ть→написа́ть, идти́→пойти́*.
*   a different **suffix** is sometimes used: *опозда́ть→опа́здывать*
*   occasionally, the **stress** changes: *нареза́ть→наре́зать*
*   **different stems** are used for a few verbs: *говори́ть→сказа́ть*.


Note that suffixation is very popular for *secondary* imperfectives. Since usually only one prefixed verb is considered an "ideal match" for an imperfective verb, all others are somewhat different in meaning (or a lot different). But you need imperfective pairs for these, too, so Russian uses suffixes for that:

*   чита́ть = to read (imperf.)
*   перечита́ть = to reread (perf.) → cannot be considered a "natural" perfective for this verb
*   перечи́тывать = to reread (imperf.)


### can

The verb «мочь» is used to talk about the general possibility of something, and also, very often—about your ability to perform something and reach some result. Perfectives are used in the second meaning:

*   Я могу́ написа́ть кни́гу за ме́сяц = I can write a book in a month.
*   Она́ мо́жет посмотре́ть? = Can she take a look?


### опять / снова

Both mean "again" and are largely interchangeable when they mean that an action from the past occurs again.

«Опять» is several times more popular but it's focused on staying "the same as before". «Снова» (cf. «новый») can also mean action performed "anew, from the beginning". 

Only «опять» is used in «опять же» (~"besides").

When asking someone to repeat, use «ещё раз».

### What else is there to it?

**imperfective verbs**

*   name the action as a whole  (“I can *swim*”)
*   describe prolonged ***states*** and ***processes***, regular actions


**Perfective verbs** describe **events**: singular, definite actions that are viewed as localized in time. They “happened” at some moment (“I made a video”, “I slept for some time and then went outside”). Or they describe a certain change of state at some "turning point" (not yet eaten→eaten, not slept enough→slept enough and ready to get up).

It is argued in a few works that "a natural" perfective is just a prefixed verb where a prefix's metaphorical meaning so conveniently overlaps the verb's own meaning, that you cannot feel any change. So don't be surprised if some vague actions have several perfective matches for a single imperfective verb. 

That also means that sometimes you'd better memorize a pair even if it is technically a "poor" match. After all, in some contexts it will come in handy:

*   есть → съе́сть (to consume something, completely)
*   есть → пое́сть (to have a meal, to spend some time eating—regardless of whether you finish your meal or decide you've had enough half-way)


## Instrumental Case

 ### Fortunately, this is the very last case!

It is used for some very specific meanings, that’s why we've put off covering it for so long.

*   It is used alone for a “tool” or an “agent” of an action. English mostly uses “with” or “by” instead: “молотк**ом**” (with hammer), ”ветр**ом**” (by wind), “сил**ой**” (by force)
*   It is used alone with some verbs of “being”, “becoming”, “seeming”: *Я стал учител**ем*** ~ “I have become a teacher”


It is also used with prepositions:
- **с (со)** = “with” (together with someone/something) — note that with prepositions “Я с ней” or even “Мы с ней” is the most natural way of saying “She and I”
- **за**/ **перед** — behind/ in front of
- **над**/ **под** — above/under
- **между** — between (also used with Genitive)

### Мы с тобой

When you tell someone about "you and I" or "my friend and I" etc., it is most idiomatic to use **мы с** + your companion in Instrumental. 

*   Мы с тобой друзья. = You and I are friends.
*   Мы с мамой вчера купили компьютер. = Mom and I bought a computer yesterday.


Of course, when translating sentences out of the blue, you cannot (strictly speaking) tell if a speaker means "I" or "we". This is rarely a source of confusion in real situations (where it is unlikely a speaker goes on randomly switching between "I" and "we" ). 

Sometimes you can interpret a joint action using "and" or "with", whatever sounds more natural:

*   Мы с ними вчера не говорили. = They and I didn't talk yesterday / I didn't talk with (to) them yesterday.


### But wait, there's more!

Actually, Russian also has a handful of inconsistent cases that only exist for some words. They are (mostly) beyond the scope of this course:

*   ***the Locative-2: the most important*** Why? Because it's obligatory with the nouns that it applies to. It expresses the meaning of place, with *в*,*на* or both. It exists for over a hundred masculine nouns: в год**у**, на мост**у**, в лес**у**, на пол**у**. And for about 20 feminine nouns in —**ь**: в кров**и** (the ending is always stressed for both!)
*   ***the Neo-vocative:*** a form of a name used when addressing a person. It exists for common names and several nouns: ***Вань! Вер! Алён! Мам! Пап!*** (just the last vowel sound is removed). The Historical vocative  ("человек → человече") has been lost in modern Russian.
*   ***the Genitive-2***　for “some amount of substance”. Increasingly replaced by the usual Genitive but still can be used for several masculine nouns: “Хочу ча**ю**”
*   ***“Waiting” case:*** not much of a case, but actually the verb “ждать” (to wait) would use Accusative for people and things that can affect their appearance and Genitive for everything else (an event/thing that does not  choose when to arrive).


## Body, Life and Death

 ### You have big eyes

Be careful NOT to use «есть» when describing properties of body parts, if their existence is normal and unlikely to surprise anyone:

*   У меня длинный нос = *I have a long nose*.


### A Handy thing to know

The Russian words for limbs and what they have on the end of them can be a little confusing initially. Depending on the situation, рука can mean hand or it can mean arm. The same is true for нога; it can be foot or leg. Most of the time the meaning is clear from the context.


## Genitive Plural

 ### The formation of Genitive Plural

All other forms (except the Nominative) are the same for all plural nouns, regardless of gender. The Genitive is the other exception. Here is how it is formed:

*   

**-а, -я, -о nouns**: just remove the last vowel sound. Extends to **-ия** and **-ие** nouns (which become **-ий**). A vowel is inserted if a consonant cluster forms at the end. We will address a few common cases of *fleeting vowels* later in the course. 

    *   ма́ма, неде́ля → **мам**, неде́ль
    *   сло́во, окно́ → **слов**, о́кон
    *   фами́лия, мело́дия → фами́лий, мело́дий
    *   ко́шка → ко́шек

*   

**hard consonant**: typical “masculine” nouns ending in *hard* non-sibilant consonants get the ending **-ов**. Those in “-й” get **-ев**, and so do nouns in “-ц” when the ending is unstressed (which won't help you much). 

    *   стол, оте́ц, го́род → **столо́в**, отцо́в, городо́в
    *   ме́сяц → ме́сяцев

*   

**soft consonant**: feminine and masculine nouns ending in **-ь** or hushes (Ж, Ш, Щ, Ч) will get **-ей** as the ending. Neuter nouns ending in **-е** also use this pattern.

    *   ночь, крова́ть → **ноче́й**, крова́тей
    *   учи́тель, муж → учителе́й, муже́й
    *   мо́ре → **море́й**

*   

«и́мя» and «вре́мя» become **имён, времён** (though, for «се́мя» and «стре́мя» it is «семя́н» and «стремя́н»)

### Not so easy

*   

be careful around nouns that form plurals irregularly, like друг →**друзья́**. Here are the genitive plurals of «друг», «мать», «дочь», «сын», «стул», «брат», «лист» and «де́рево» :

    *   **друзе́й, матере́й, дочере́й, сынове́й**
    *   **сту́льев, бра́тьев, ли́стьев, дере́вьев**



## Adjectives 2

 In this skill, we focus a bit more on adjectives and their case forms

### задача vs. задание

As a "problem" in a Math class, «задача» is more frequent.
 Other than that, «задача» may be a problem, a task, an objective—while «задание» is a task *assigned by someone else* (again, unless it's an exercise you randomly encountered in your textbook).

### Superlative

When you want to express "the most" strong degree of some quality, Russian will almost always use an analytical form. Just add the adjective «самый» in front:

*   Это самая длинная книга.
*   Ты самый плохой папа.


There are one-word forms for many adjectives, though few of them are popular. Here are the *synthetic* forms, to give you an idea:

*   **лучший, худший**, быстрейший, теплейший
*   интереснейший, длиннейший, кратчайший
*   наилучший, наидлиннейший, наисложнейший


**наи-**prefixed versions should be used with extreme care since they will almost always sound too fancy for spoken language and too emotional for academic writing. Still, a few of most popular may be just the right thing in written style (eg. *наилучший, наихудший, наисложнейший*).


## Predicates and States(+Adverbs)

 ### Practical Short Adjectives

Adjectives in Russian have a long form and a short one. A long one is used before nouns and as a part of a predicate. A short "predicative" form can ONLY be used as a predicate (with a "to be" verb).  Usually it looks ***the same as an adverb***. 

To be more exact, that typically refers to adjectives that mean qualities that exist on a sliding scale (good, short, soft etc.) rather than yes/no characteristics (wooden, American). 

***Their usage*** depends on the meaning and style and isn't all that easy. It is especially frustrating for a learner when a short and a long form are interchangeable but modify the overall tone.

Now, from a practical point of view, a number of adjectives are used in a short form *very often* (or always) and/or have a *distinct meaning* then. It is safe to say that the majority of adjectives in the language aren't much used in short form, so better learn those that are.

That's what we are going to do. And you get adverbs for free.

### Other predicative adjectives/adverbs uses

*   feeling/state: It is cold/I feel cold: *«Мне холодно. Тут холодно. Дома всегда хорошо»*. Is not even considered an adjective in most descriptions. Usually linguists define them as a "category of state"
*   general judgement of the form "You are wrong"/"It is perfect/bad" → *Это просто отлично. Ты неправ.*
*   *«Превосходно!»* — short sentences like "Good!" or "Magnificent!". Actually, that's where a huge variety of adjectives with a meaning of "terrific"/"awful" are used in the short form, even if hardly anywhere else.
*   when an adjective like "glad" or "similar" has details on what you are glad about or similar to, it is normally short.


## Education

 ### Ordinal numbers

Russian ordinal numbers behave like adjectives. Also, thankfully, if you have a long number *only the last word* is affected when the gender and/or case change:

*   31st = три́дцать пе́рв**ый**
*   on the 31st of December = три́дцать пе́рв**ого** декабря́ *(it is Genitive here)*


### High-rise

The floor numbering uses the system common in the U.S., i.e. the floor on the ground level is "the 1st floor". This is what you are going to see on the elevator buttons—so we try to stick to this "literal" translation. 

### University departments

A typical structure of a university::

**университе́т**

↳**факульте́т** ("department"), **отделе́ние** ("subdivision")

.    ​‍‍‎‏↳ **ка́федра** ("branch")

If a "department" (a.k.a. "a faculty") is really large, it may have several "отделе́ния" inside, which are then subdived further into "ка́федры". 

A university can also have an "институ́т" ("institute") inside. Or a number of them. An institute may have departments of its own.

### Grades

The grading system in Russia uses numbers 2 to 5:

*   **2**, «неудовлетвори́тельно» —"fail", an F
*   **3**, «удовлетвори́тельно» —a "just about satisfactory" mark, something like a C minus 
*   **4**, «хорошо́» —a "good" mark, similar to a B
*   **5**, «отли́чно»—an "excellent" mark, an A


In speech we usually call them **«дво́йка», «тро́йка», «четвёрка»** and **«пятёрка»**. «Едини́ца»(1) is virtually never assigned (maybe only in the case of particularly mighty failure, combining poor performance with misdemeanor).

Universities—officially—only use the words («неуд.», «уд.»/«удовл.», «хор.», «отл.» when abbreviated). And yet, the numbers are also widely used in conversation.

### Classes

A school lesson is 45 minutes long, followed by a short break («переме́на»). 

A class at a university consists of two 45-minute-long periods, often with a 5-minute break in between. This is why people usually call it **«па́ра»** ("a pair, a couple"). In the Russian Far East «ле́нта»("a ribbon") is a more popular term—but do not try your luck using this term anywhere else!

Summer break and shorter breaks during the academic year are **«кани́кулы»**. This is a plural-only noun.

### Grades (the other kind)

Finally, a word (or two) about grades/school years. For the sake of convenience, this course assumes that первый класс is the exact equivalent of first grade or year one, etc, which may or may not be the case depending on where you're from. For the record, Russian schools run from первый класс when you are six or seven years old to одиннадцатый класс when you are seventeen, although the last two years are not compulsory.


## Countries and Places

 ### Sweden, a Swede, Swedish

In Russian, the name of the country, the name of a person from there and their language are all different words. They are related, however, and few patterns exist:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>country</th>
<th>male</th>
<th>female</th>
<th>adjective</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>А́нглия</td>
<td>англича́нин</td>
<td>англича́нка</td>
<td>англи́йский</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Кита́й (China)</td>
<td>кита́ец</td>
<td>китая́нка</td>
<td>кита́йский</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ита́лия</td>
<td>италья́нец</td>
<td>италья́нка</td>
<td>италья́нский</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Кана́да</td>
<td>кана́дец</td>
<td>кана́дка</td>
<td>кана́дский</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Аме́рика</td>
<td>америка́нец</td>
<td>америка́нка</td>
<td>америка́нский</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Казахста́н</td>
<td>каза́х</td>
<td>каза́шка</td>
<td>каза́хский</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Фра́нция</td>
<td>францу́з</td>
<td>францу́женка</td>
<td>францу́зский</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


It's worth pointing out here (in case you hadn't spotted it already) that while English capitalizes country/language adjectives, Russian does not.

### Simple Future

Describing a "simple" future action (not a process) is rather straightforward—take a perfective verb and make its "present" form same as you did with imperfective. The difference is, perfective verbs have no Present:

*   Ду́маю, тебе́ понра́вится Том = I think you'll like Tom. (from *нра́виться/по́нравиться*)
*   Я приду́ в шко́лу = I'll come to school. (*прийти* is a  prefixed perfective variant of «идти»)


English, of course, has a number of ways of expressing the future, so use "will" or "is going to" (or indeed the present continuous/progressive) as you deem appropriate.

#### Программи́ст-кана́дец

Since in Russian, ethnicity is described with a noun, they can produce hyphenated compounds (just like other nouns). We have very few of them in this course.

*   писа́тель-италья́нец = an Italian writer
*   студе́нт-худо́жник = a student who is an artist
*   студе́нт-каза́х = a Kazakh student
*   подру́га-англича́нка = an English friend *(fem.)*


### Speak English!

You can use both «говорить по-английски» (adverb) and «говорить на английском» (*на + Instr.*)

«На английском» is specifically about content in the language or about linguistic ability. «По-английски» is about the *way* an action is done/ an object is made (does not mean language for objects).

So a book can only be written «на английском». And, of course, if you mean "English-style pizza", it can only be «пицца по-английски»!
